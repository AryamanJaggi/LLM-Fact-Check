            "Victim(s): Dale Harrell\n",
            "Court Decision: Convicted of first-degree murder for bludgeoning her husband to death with a hammer and sentenced to life in prison​.\n",
            "Case facts:\n",
            "\n",
            "The murder of Dale Harrell (December 18, 1974 – February 9, 2009) occurred after he was fatally attacked on January 14, 2009, by his wife Marissa-Suzanne \"Reese\" DeVault (born November 6, 1977) in Maricopa County, Arizona. Her trial made national and global headlines. The case was noted as being very similar to that of the murder of Travis Alexander by Jodi Arias, with whom DeVault was in contact and whose murder trial occurred in the same courthouse one year earlier. Though she faced the possibility of a death penalty for her crime, DeVault was sentenced to life in prison. She is imprisoned at Perryville within the Arizona Department of Corrections.\n",
            "Murder and investigation\n",
            "On January 14, 2009, DeVault entered the master bedroom that she and Harrell shared at their home in Gilbert, Arizona. She then struck Harrell several times in the head while he was sleeping. Harrell received multiple skull fractures and was taken to the hospital. DeVault initially claimed that Harrell was beaten by an unknown assailant who had broken into the home. She later confessed that she had beaten Harrell as an act of self-defense, and alleged that Harrell was physically and sexually abusive. DeVault was arrested the same night on charges of aggravated assault and was held at a local jail, but was later released on bail. Officers noted that DeVault had reddened marks upon her neck, and that they had found a hammer covered with blood at the crime scene. In early February 2009, DeVault was indicted for attempted murder and released on bond.\n",
            "On February 9, 2009, Harrell died of his wounds and a grand jury indicted DeVault for first-degree murder. At 3:00 a.m. the next morning, DeVault was assaulted by an unknown assailant as she was jogging, suffering a broken jaw and ankle. Following the beating, police investigated a man who lived with DeVault, Stanley Cook, Jr., and found dirty, bloody clothing.\n",
            "Both DeVault and Cook initially told police that Cook had killed Harrell. Cook had a brain injury that caused him to suffer from short-term memory loss— neither he nor DeVault could provide details concerning his involvement. Police found no evidence linking Cook to the crime; indeed, forensic evidence ruled out Cook having been the assailant. When confronted with this fact, DeVault confessed that she had bludgeoned her husband with the hammer.\n",
            "After Harrell was cremated at a Mesa mortuary, DeVault refused to give the remains to his parents, who then filed a civil suit against her for Harrell's remains and punitive damages. DeVault filed a 300-page confession with the Gilbert police where she detailed the years of alleged abuse, stating that Harrell had beaten and raped her on January 14, prompting her to assault him with the hammer. She also reported that Harrell had frequently sent her to the hospital, and that he had once, in front of several witnesses, shoved her and dislocated her shoulder, which one of the witnesses helped pop back into place. During this time, police interviewed friends of DeVault and Harrell. The police found that they had no evidence to corroborate claims that Harrell had been abusive towards DeVault. They also mentioned that DeVault had lied to them in the past about receiving a large inheritance from the death of her stepfather, who was in fact not deceased. DeVault was also discovered to have lied about an older lover she was seeing, Allen Flores. She borrowed over $300,000 from Flores, who had been introduced to police as an ex-lover of her stepfather. Flores' house was searched twice, and the police located a computer with child pornography on it. Flores later agreed to testify on the Harrell murder in exchange for full immunity over the pornography charges.\n",
            "Trial\n",
            "DeVault was initially set to go to trial in 2011, but the trial was postponed. The prosecutors in the case sought the death penalty. Defense attorneys stated that DeVault had battered woman syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, which they used to argue against the death penalty. Jury selection for the new trial began in January 2014, where Judge Roland Steinle commented that he did not want anyone on the jury that had been overly focused on the Jodi Arias trial. The trial for DeVault officially began on January 22, 2014, and was expected to run until April.\n",
            "In their opening statements, the defense and prosecutors posed different reasons as to DeVault's motivations for beating Harrell with a hammer. Prosecutors alleged that DeVault killed Harrell with the intention of collecting on a total of $1,250,000 from two life insurance policies, so she could repay Allen Flores the $300,000 she had borrowed from him, while DeVault's defense attorneys claimed that DeVault acted in self-defense. The defense also stated that DeVault had experienced abuse as a child, and that her mother had physically abused her, while her stepfather had sexually abused her. Dr. Jon Conte, a clinical psychologist that was also knowledgeable about the effects of child abuse, testified on behalf of the defense, stating that he believed that DeVault's actions were consistent with a long history of childhood abuse. One of DeVault's children also testified that she had witnessed Harrell abuse her mother. The prosecution countered this with testimony from clinical psychologist Dr. Janeen DeMarte, who diagnosed DeVault as having antisocial personality disorder. She also questioned why DeVault would give custody of her children to her mother and stepfather after DeVault had earlier claimed that they had abused her. The prosecution also pointed out that DeVault had initially claimed that an unknown assailant had broken into the home and assaulted Harrell, before confessing that she was the perpetrator.\n",
            "On April 8, 2014, DeVault was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder for the death of Harrell, and the jury found that excessive cruelty had been used which made DeVault eligible for the death penalty. In a statement to the court, DeVault apologized for the murder, saying that she was \"sorry, not only for my actions, but for everyone I hurt\". She also addressed Harrell's parents, stating that, \"My heart goes out to them...his mother and father have had to experience the worst loss in the world – the loss of a child. I know there is nothing I can say that will ever ease their pain.\"\n",
            "Sentencing\n",
            "The penalty phase of the trial commenced on April 15, and deliberations began on April 22. The jury sentenced DeVault to life in prison instead of the death penalty, and Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery stated that, \"imposing the death penalty in any circumstance is difficult, and in this one, the jurors apparently felt that a life sentence was appropriate\". On June 6, 2014, the judge sentenced DeVault to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n",
            "\n",
            "Defendant: Jamie Hood\n",
            "Victim(s): Kenneth Omari Wray and Athens-Clarke County Police Officer Elmer Christian, among others affected by the crimes listed.\n",
            "Court decision: Charged on a total of 36 counts, which include murder, aggravated assault, kidnapping, carjacking, and other offenses.\n",
            "Case Facts:\n",
            "\n",
            "Appellant Jamie Donnell Hood appeals his 2015 convictions on a total of 36 counts charging him with murder, aggravated assault, kidnapping, carjacking, and other offenses. The charges arose from the December 2010 shooting death of Kenneth Omari Wray and a series of crimes in March 2011 that resulted in the death of AthensClarke County Police Officer Elmer Christian. \n",
            "The evidence at trial showed that Appellant was involved in the drug trade and had been supplying an associate, Kenyatta Campbell, with marijuana from a third party in Atlanta. At some point before the crimes, Campbell began bypassing Appellant by purchasing directly from the source, angering Appellant. \n",
            "On the evening of December 28, 2010, Wray, an associate of Campbell, was shot outside the Athens home Wray shared with his mother, Ruby Jordan. Jordan testified that on the night of the shooting, she was dozing in her bedroom when she heard a knock or slam on the door and then another loud noise and her son calling for her. She then heard what sounded like firecrackers. Jordan peeked out the door and saw someone run from her driveway and, believing it was Wray, returned to her bedroom. A few minutes later, a friend of Wray came to the door, looking for Wray, and then saw him lying in the driveway. \n",
            "The friend, Billy Howington, testified that he had arranged to buy marijuana from Wray on the night of December 28. Shortly before arriving at Wray’s home, he texted Wray that he was approaching. When Howington arrived, he parked his car in front of the house and waited for Wray to come out. Wray did not appear and did not return Howington’s texts or calls. Finally, Howington went to the door, and as he was talking to Jordan he realized Wray was lying in the driveway. \n",
            "A neighbor of Jordan, Mike Barnett, came outside after hearing a loud noise from the direction of Jordan’s home and saw Wray’s body in the driveway. As he was dialing 911, Barnett was approached by a police officer patrolling nearby, and emergency responders were dispatched. Wray had sustained multiple gunshot wounds, including one through his neck, and died after being transported to the hospital. \n",
            "At the scene, investigators recovered six .40-caliber shell casings. Interviews with Howington and another neighbor indicated that the shooter was a black male. Appellant was not identified as a suspect at the time.\n",
            "Some three months later, on March 22, 2011, Judon Brooks, an associate of Wray and Campbell, went to Appellant’s home to inspect some marijuana. Brooks testified that, shortly after he arrived, Appellant and three masked men with firearms surrounded him, and one of the men began tying him up with zip ties. Appellant demanded that Brooks tell him Campbell’s whereabouts. When Brooks replied that he did not know, Appellant brandished a knife and threatened to kill him. The men put duct tape over Brooks’ mouth, covered his face, and put him in the trunk of Appellant’s car. Appellant drove away with Brooks in the trunk. After managing to break his hands free, Brooks opened the trunk latch and escaped when the car came to a stop. An acquaintance of Brooks who happened to be driving in the same vicinity saw him in the street seeking help and summoned him to his car. Brooks called 911, and a “be on the lookout” notice (BOLO) was issued for Appellant. \n",
            "In the meantime, Appellant had abandoned his car and called his brother, Matthew Hood, to pick him up. Athens-Clarke County Police Officer Tony Howard testified that he was patrolling the area in response to the BOLO. He recognized Matthew driving and flagged him down. When Matthew stopped, Officer Howard saw a man he recognized as Appellant exit Matthew’s car and run toward the driver’s side of Officer Howard’s patrol car. Officer Howard grabbed Appellant through his open window, but Appellant broke free, then turned and shot Officer Howard in the face and the back. The responding EMT testified that when he arrived on the scene, Officer Howard’s gun was still in the holster on his belt.\n",
            "Appellant continued running and came upon Officer Christian’s patrol car. Two witnesses saw Appellant run past the car and shoot twice through the driver’s side window. Officer Christian, who at the time was talking on his phone, was struck by both bullets. By the time emergency responders arrived, Officer Christian was deceased. \n",
            "Continuing to run, Appellant approached a stopped car, in which Deborah Lumpkin was sitting. Lumpkin testified that Appellant, who was armed with a gun, got in the passenger seat and told her that he was running from the police and needed her to drive. She complied. After a short time, Appellant, whom Lumpkin described as calm and focused, instructed her to stop and get out. Appellant drove off and later abandoned the car, continuing his escape on foot. \n",
            "The manhunt for Appellant proceeded into the following day and night. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on March 24, Appellant went to the home of Darius Lanier, a longtime acquaintance, who supplied Appellant with food and clothing. Lanier testified that, during Appellant’s time at his home, Appellant admitted to shooting the two police officers. Appellant also told Lanier that he had killed Wray because Wray would not tell him where he could find Campbell. Appellant left at around 4:00 a.m. Later that morning, Lanier reported Appellant’s visit to his probation officer, who contacted the police. \n",
            "After leaving Lanier’s home, Appellant found his way to the Athens subdivision of Creekstone, where he gained entry into the home of Chayandre Bess and Mandrell Hull, also acquaintances of Appellant. Bess’s 13-year-old cousin, who was living with Bess and Hull at the time, testified that, as she prepared to leave for school on the morning of March 24, Appellant approached her outside the home, brandished a gun, and ordered her to let him inside. Bess, Hull, and others in the home testified that Appellant forced them into a single room, then barricaded them in the home and held them hostage until the following evening, when he surrendered to the police.\n",
            "During his time in the Creekstone home, Appellant made several incriminating statements about the murder of Wray, kidnapping of Brooks, and shootings of Officers Howard and Christian. These witnesses testified that Appellant said he had shot Wray when Wray would not tell him where Campbell lived and that Appellant described specifically how Wray had called for his mother before being killed. Appellant also told these witnesses that he had kidnapped Brooks for the same reason and had intended to kill him as well. Appellant also said that, while he was sorry for killing Officer Christian, he was glad he had shot Officer Howard, with whom he had a history of ill will. In reference to the gun he used to shoot Officers Howard and Christian, Appellant remarked, “[I]f you think this one’s pretty, you should have see[n] the one I killed Omari [Wray] with.” Many of Appellant’s statements about the crimes were surreptitiously recorded by one of the Creekstone witnesses, Quintin Riden, and the recordings were played for the jury at trial.\n",
            "Also while at the home, Appellant had phone conversations with both Brooks and Campbell. Brooks testified that Appellant told him, “B**ch, you better be lucky you got away. . . . I was going to kill your b**ch a** just like I did your boy”; Brooks believed Appellant’s statement was a reference to Wray’s murder. In Appellant’s conversation with Campbell, which Riden overheard and testified about, Appellant told Campbell that the reason he killed Wray was “because yo’ b**ch a** was hiding out. You got [Wray] killed because I couldn’t find you.”\n",
            "Shortly after his surrender on March 25, Appellant was interviewed by investigators and admitted that he had shot Officers Howard and Christian. He wrote a letter of apology to Officer Christian’s family, telling them that “I just seen [Christian] at the wrong time in the wrong situation.” The video recording of Appellant’s interview was played for the jury, and the letter was read aloud at trial. \n",
            "The State also offered audio recordings of two police interviews with Lanier, both of which were played for the jury. In the first interview, conducted on March 24, 2011, Lanier told the detective that Appellant admitted he had shot two police officers and hijacked a woman’s car and said he wanted to kill Campbell before he turned himself in. Lanier also told the detective that Appellant said he had killed Wray. In the second interview, conducted in April 2011, Lanier again stated that Appellant admitted to killing the officers and to killing Wray; that Appellant said he had gotten rid of the gun with which he had killed Wray; and that he had killed Wray because Wray would not reveal Campbell’s whereabouts.\n",
            "The State also offered testimony from a GBI firearms examiner that a .40-caliber shell casing, found in a search of Appellant’s car, was fired from the same gun as that used to shoot Wray. Additional testimony established that Wray had been shot seven times, but that only six shell casings were recovered from the scene. The firearms examiner also testified that the gun used to kill Wray was not the same gun used in the police shootings.\n",
            "Appellant testified in his own defense. He maintained that he was not involved in Wray’s murder and told the jury that the shell casing found in his car was the vestige of an armed robbery of which he had been a victim, in which the assailant’s gun had discharged in his car during their struggle. Appellant also claimed that the Brooks kidnapping incident was actually initiated by Brooks, when Brooks showed up at his house with two men, threatening to kill him. Appellant claimed it was only in response that he and his associates tied Brooks up and drove away with him. Appellant testified further that, when he was fleeing after the Brooks kidnapping and encountered Officers Howard and Christian, he heard the voice of his deceased brother — who had been killed by a police officer — telling him, “Don’t let them do you like they done me.” Appellant testified that he continued running “out of fear. I’m running trying to get away. I’m running not to kill. I’m running to get away from them. They fixing to kill me, man.” \n",

            "Case facts: \n",
            "\n",
            "The Crime\n",
            "MacNeill lived with his wife, Michele, and their four minor daughters in Pleasant Grove, Utah. The MacNeills also had three adult children; two lived in Utah and one attended graduate school out of state. MacNeill practiced psychiatry, and Michele tended to their home and children.\n",
            "MacNeill met Gypsy Gillian Willis online, and the two began an affair in November 2005. In March 2007 Michele expressed concern to her adult daughter, Alexis, who attended graduate school, that MacNeill might be having an affair. After reading through his telephone records, Michele discovered the identity of MacNeill's girlfriend. When she confronted MacNeill, he claimed she was being “ridiculous.” Shortly after this confrontation, MacNeill surprised Michele with a facelift as a “present.” He also indicated that he wanted to take her on a two-week cruise after her surgery.\n",
            "Around the same time, during a “heartfelt, tearful lesson” at church, MacNeill announced that he had cancer and had “less than a year” to live. His health appeared to deteriorate—he began limping, walking with a cane, and wearing a surgical boot. Despite his claim to neighbors that he “had some procedures done [and] was having some complications,” MacNeill painted a somewhat different picture of his condition at work. He told one colleague that he had a “peripheral neuropathy” in his toe that “wouldn't get better,” another colleague that he had “cancer in his big toe,” and yet another colleague that he had a “neurological ․ problem similar to MS.” But despite his scattered claims of various illnesses during that spring, MacNeill remodeled his basement on his own and appeared to have no difficulty carrying “giant [slabs] of sheet rock” down the stairs.\n",
            "MacNeill scheduled a consultation with a plastic surgeon in March 2007 and attended the consultation with Michele. MacNeill was the “dominant personality” at the appointment and did “more of the talking” than Michele. Although Michele was nervous about having surgery and concerned about the associated risks, the recovery, and the downtime, she agreed to schedule comprehensive facial surgery for the following month.\n",
            "MacNeill next scheduled an examination for Michele with a primary care physician to determine if it was safe for her to proceed with surgery. MacNeill was anxious to complete the evaluation so Michele could proceed with the surgery without delay. At the appointment, the three discussed Michele's high blood pressure. The primary care physician said that it would be ideal to control Michele's blood pressure before surgery and suggested that she postpone the operation. MacNeill expressed disappointment with this suggestion. Other than Michele's elevated blood pressure, the primary care physician determined that she was in “excellent health.” An EKG revealed that Michele's heart was normal without any arrhythmias or evidence of heart disease.\n",
            "Although the primary care physician recommended that Michele delay the procedure, Michele and MacNeill kept the appointment for the preoperative evaluation with the surgeon. Alexis came home from graduate school to attend the appointment with them. Before the appointment, Alexis saw MacNeill in his room writing down medications that he wanted the doctor to prescribe, using a “dusty” reference book that she hadn't seen him use in perhaps ten or fifteen years. On the way to the appointment, Michele said that she wanted to push the appointment back until summer so she could make sure her blood pressure would be under control. MacNeill became angry, raised his voice, told Michele she could not do that, and said, “If you don't have the surgery now, you're not getting it.”\n",
            "At the appointment, neither Michele nor MacNeill disclosed the primary care physician's recommendations, although MacNeill did mention that she had “some high blood pressure” and “had been prescribed some medication” for it. MacNeill directed the discussion about Michele's postoperative medication regimen. After performing a facelift, the surgeon typically prescribed a pain reliever (Lortab), an antibiotic (cephalexin), a sleeping medication (Ambien), an anti-inflammatory (Medral Dose Pack), and an eye ointment (erythromycin). Occasionally, he prescribed an anti-nausea medication (Phenergan) to patients that complained of nausea associated with anesthesia.\n",
            "Consulting the list he brought with him, MacNeill requested four deviations from the surgeon's usual protocol. First, he requested an additional, stronger pain reliever, oxycodone, also known as Percocet. Second, he requested Lortab in liquid form. Third, he requested more than the typical amount of Phenergan, and he requested it in suppository form. Finally, he requested the anti-anxiety drug, Valium. MacNeill said that “he was just concerned that [Michele] wouldn't do well without having these other options available,” and that he wanted to have “all of the options available to [him],” even though Michele had told him that she didn't like to take a lot of medicine. The surgeon complied with MacNeill's requests and gave Michele instructions to take one pill at a time and “certainly” to avoid taking all of them together. Michele assured the surgeon she “was going to try and minimize the amount of medication that she took.”\n",
            "Two days later, MacNeill drove Michele and Alexis to the surgical facility for the operation. The surgery lasted all day, but the surgeon told Alexis that he was happy with the results. Michele was “in a little bit of pain and groggy” and “wanted to stay the night at the hospital.” MacNeill returned to drive Michele and Alexis home. When Michele said she wanted to stay the night, he became angry and told Michele that they needed to go home. But he acquiesced when the surgeon explained that he prefers to keep his patients overnight. The surgeon released Michele the next morning.\n",
            "On the day Michele returned home, Alexis acted as her caregiver, giving her medications, dressing her wounds, and helping her to the bathroom, because Michele was “effectively blind.” Alexis kept a log of Michele's medications on a pad of paper and included the time she took each pill and the dose. Alexis also kept a log of Michele's vital signs and food intake in what she called her “little black book.” She later combined the two logs and placed the pad of paper in a drawer next to Michele's bed. That evening MacNeill insisted that Alexis leave the room because he would be taking over Michele's care. Alexis left and slept in her youngest sister's room.\n",
            "The next morning Alexis entered her mother's room and noticed that she “appeared to be very sedated.” When Alexis tried to wake Michele, she stirred a bit but did not wake up. Alexis asked MacNeill what had happened, and he responded that he “must have given her too much medicine.” When Alexis pressed further, he said he had given Michele Lortab, Valium, and Ambien, at which point Michele threw up. He then gave her Phenergan, Percocet, and more Lortab. Alexis told her father that he was “not to give her any more medicine,” because she (Alexis) was “taking over.”\n",
            "Later that evening Michele told Alexis that MacNeill “kept giving [her] medication” and “telling [her] to swallow,” and when she started to throw up he gave her more and more medication. Michele stated that she did not want MacNeill to give her any more medicine; she felt each different pill “so that if [MacNeill] tried to give her anything, she would know what he was giving her.”\n",
            "Alexis continued to care for her mother. Once Michele's bandages came off, her recovery accelerated. By April 10 Michele was able to walk around and care for herself. She took no Valium, Phenergan, or Ambien. Because Michele was sensitive to medications, she tried to take less than the prescribed dosage. Although Michele was tapering off her medications, MacNeill called the surgeon and asked him to refill Michele's prescriptions for Percocet and Phenergan, which he did at a follow-up appointment. Alexis attended the appointment with Michele, then returned to school.\n",
            "The next day MacNeill took the couple's younger daughters to school. Before leaving for school, one of the girls entered Michele's room and found her mother sitting on the couch in front of her TV. The girl noticed “nothing odd about [Michele's] behavior.” The two “had a perfectly ․ normal conversation” before the girl said goodbye and went to school. Alexis called at 8:45 a.m. and Michele said she was “doing great” and planned to pick the girls up from school. She did not sound confused, and her speech did not sound slurred. At 9:15 a.m., MacNeill called Alexis and left a voicemail urging her to call her mother and tell her to stay in bed. Alexis found this strange in light of her earlier phone conversation with her mother. Alexis called her mother, but Michele did not answer.\n",
            "MacNeill was to receive an award at work that morning. Before the event MacNeill adamantly told the event coordinator that he needed his picture taken at the event. After receiving the award, he asked the photographer, “Did you get me in that picture? Make sure you got me in that picture.” After the photographer assured MacNeill that he was in the picture, MacNeill pressed him again, saying, “Maybe you better take a second one and make sure you got me in that picture.” After the event, MacNeill picked up the couple's youngest daughter from kindergarten at 11:30 a.m.\n",
            "When MacNeill and his youngest daughter got home, she called, “Mom, I'm home.” Michele didn't answer. The girl followed her father into the bathroom and found her mother “all the way” in the bathtub, lying in the water, still in her clothes. MacNeill told his daughter to run next door for help.\n",
            "Meanwhile, MacNeill called 911. MacNeill gave the dispatcher a false address and hung up. MacNeill called again and said, “My wife has fallen in the bathtub ․ [s]he is unconscious. She's under water.” MacNeill said he “couldn't lift her” so he let the water out of the tub. Although the dispatcher asked him to stay on the phone, MacNeill hung up again. The dispatcher called back, and MacNeill told her that he had “CPR in progress.” Although the dispatcher requested that he stay on the phone, MacNeill again hung up. He then called a colleague at work and told him he was “doing a code on his wife.” At this time, MacNeill's phone rang again—it was Alexis. He told her, “Your mother's in the tub and she's not breathing.” Alexis immediately went to the airport to fly home.\n",
            "The daughter returned to the bathroom with their neighbor. They found MacNeill “hunched over” Michele's face. Michele was face up, her head under the faucet, her legs and feet inside the bathtub. Two more neighbors came in and observed Michele's body in the same position: face up, with her head under the faucet, and her legs and feet inside the bathtub. They lifted Michele out of the tub and MacNeill began CPR. One of the neighbors performed chest compressions while MacNeill leaned over Michele's head to periodically administer rescue breaths. However, the neighbor did not observe MacNeill's mouth ever touching Michele's, nor did Michele's chest rise and fall when MacNeill administered the rescue breaths. Two paramedics arrived and took over CPR. When the paramedics began CPR, Michele's color instantly changed from bluish to a pink fleshy color. A gurgling sound came from her chest, and she expelled quite a lot of fluid from her mouth more than once—at least three to four cups the first time and a substantial amount the second time.\n",
            "While the paramedics performed CPR, MacNeill told them that he had only been away from the home “for a short period of time,” during which Michele “overdosed on her pain medication,” slipped in the tub, and hit her head. MacNeill said he found Michele face down, “slumped over the tub” with her upper body inside the tub and her lower body out of the tub. MacNeill then began yelling and became increasingly loud and agitated—to the point that the officers and paramedics feared for their safety and removed him from the room. Shortly thereafter, the ambulance arrived, and MacNeill accompanied Michele to the hospital.\n",
            "Michele was pronounced dead on arrival. The emergency-room doctor saw no injuries consistent with falling into the bathtub. Because the doctor could not determine the cause of death, he called the Medical Examiner's Office.\n",
            "The MacNeills' adult son returned home that evening with the son's girlfriend. MacNeill asked the two to accompany him to the bathroom where MacNeill had found Michele that morning. The son's girlfriend noticed that the bathroom was clean, with no trace of blood, although MacNeill told her when he found Michele that day “there was blood everywhere.” MacNeill asked the girlfriend to retrieve Michele's pills. She found various drugs, but some of the bottles had very few pills in them. MacNeill and his son counted the pills; MacNeill kept repeating, Michele “was not taking her pills.” MacNeill became frustrated, said he “did not want to do this anymore,” and had his son's girlfriend flush the pills down the toilet.\n",
            "When Alexis returned home that evening, she went straight to the bedroom to look for the medications. But the room had been “cleaned out.” Items that had been there the day before—a hospital bed, stuffed animals, and blankets—had been removed. The bathroom rug was gone. While looking for her mother's medication around the house, Alexis found the bathroom rug, a pile of wet towels and clothing, and other of Michele's belongings in the garage.\n",
            "Also gone was the “little black book” in which Alexis tracked her mother's medication intake. Alexis asked MacNeill where her mother's medication was; he told her, “I don't know. I think the police might have taken it.” Alexis found the small pad of paper she had tracked Michele's medication on for the first few days after surgery in the drawer where she left it.\n",
            "When Alexis asked MacNeill what happened, he took her into the bathroom to show her how he found Michele. MacNeill gave Alexis the same description he had given the paramedics: Michele was face down, “slumped over the tub” with her upper body inside the tub and her lower body outside the tub. He told Alexis that the bath was full and the water was off.\n",
            "Rachel, the MacNeills' other adult daughter, arrived later that evening. MacNeill said that they “needed to get the autopsy done ․ right away” because “he was concerned that there would be a police investigation,” and he “didn't want ․ anyone to think he murdered [Michele].”\n",
            "Although MacNeill had spent his day performing CPR on his wife, accompanying her to the hospital, cleaning up her personal belongings, tending to his family, and providing his neighbors with a tour of the renovations he completed in the home, he also spent time that day communicating with Gypsy. The two talked on the phone twice and texted each other thirty times.\n",
            "Several days later, MacNeill spoke with the Medical Examiner, Dr. Maureen Frikke. He gave the same account he had given the emergency responders and his daughters: he found Michele slumped over the tub with her face “completely submerged” and her lower body hanging outside of the tub. Dr. Frikke determined that the manner of Michele's death was “natural,” and her cause of death was cardiovascular disease with hypertension and myocarditis.\n",
            "Michele's funeral was held three days later. Before the service, MacNeill helped set up, running back and forth from the church to his car without a cane. As people started arriving, however, he began limping and using the cane. Gypsy attended the funeral, and the two texted throughout the service. After the funeral, a family friend approached MacNeill and offered to help care for his minor daughters. MacNeill told her that he had already hired a nanny.\n",
            "MacNeill's adult daughters also offered to care for their younger siblings, but MacNeill asked Rachel to go with him to church to “pray about getting a nanny.” When Rachel arrived, MacNeill did not want to go inside, but instead remained on a bench outside the church. Soon, a woman approached Rachel and MacNeill from the parking lot and said, “I'm so sorry for your loss. I was at the funeral.” She told them that her name was Gillian and that she had attended nursing school. MacNeill asked for her phone number, and “Gillian”—who was actually Gypsy Gillian Willis—left. Nine days after Michele's death, MacNeill hired Gypsy as the family nanny and moved her into the MacNeill home. However, Gypsy never fulfilled the role of a nanny in the MacNeill household—the children were “left alone” and took care of themselves.\n",
            "Gypsy and MacNeill travelled to Wyoming, where Gypsy introduced him to her family as her fiancé. By the end of the summer she held herself out to the public as Gillian MacNeill. The two applied for an identification card that listed the date of their marriage as April 14, 2007—the day of Michele's funeral.\n",
            "Having witnessed MacNeill's behavior after Michele's death, Alexis, Rachel, and Michele's sister asked investigators to re-examine Michele's manner of death. The Utah County Attorney's Office asked a toxicologist to examine Dr. Frikke's toxicology report from Michele's autopsy. The report stated that at the time of death, Michele's blood contained Valium, Percocet, Phenergan, and Ambien in concentrations likely to render her “severely obtunded,” “difficult to arouse,” potentially “asleep,” and “unable to respond constructively to [her] environment.” The Utah County Attorney's Office also asked Dr. Todd Grey, Dr. Frikke's successor, to review Dr. Frikke's conclusions. Dr. Grey changed the manner of death from “natural” to “undetermined” and changed her cause of death from heart disease to the combined effects of heart disease and drug toxicity.\n",
            "In addition to re-examining the physical evidence, the State interviewed the MacNeills' youngest daughter at the Children's Justice Center. She reported that, on the day of Michele's death, MacNeill had picked her up from school and the two returned home to find Michele in the bathtub and still in her clothes. She explained that MacNeill asked her to go next door for help, and after she brought her neighbor back to the MacNeill home, the neighbor sent her next door to play with the neighbor's two children, where she remained for the rest of the afternoon. Following the CJC interview, state investigators requested that Alexis ask the girl several follow-up questions. Alexis complied, and the girl provided more detail about the position of Michele's body in the tub, the amount of water in the tub, and the items of clothing Michele was wearing.\n",
            "The State charged MacNeill with murder, a first degree felony, and obstruction of justice, a second degree felony.\n",
            "The Trial\n",
            "Before trial, MacNeill moved to exclude the MacNeills' youngest daughter from testifying. MacNeill argued that, while questioning the girl after the CJC interview, Alexis had used improper interview techniques, resulting in “false memories.” The trial court granted MacNeill's motion in part and denied it in part. The court ruled that the girl was not competent to testify at trial because “after the Children's Justice Center interview, [the youngest MacNeill daughter] was subjected to suggestive and repeated questioning about material facts by an untrained interviewer with bias as to the suspect's guilt or innocence and bias as to her own pecuniary interests.” But the trial court admitted the girl's CJC interview, and she appeared in court at trial for cross-examination.\n",
            "MacNeill also moved to exclude the testimony of five jailhouse informants that the prosecution planned to call. Four were federal inmates who had served time with MacNeill before the State charged him with murder. One (the State Inmate) knew MacNeill from time served together in the Utah County Jail. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that “(1) the weaknesses of jailhouse informant testimony could be exposed through rigorous cross-examination; and (2) the jury would be instructed on how to judge the credibility of witnesses, and may be instructed on the heightened motive of jailhouse informants to misrepresent.” The trial court also ordered that “the State, in writing, disclose to the defense with respect to each inmate who will testify, any and all benefits promised, expressed or implied, realized now or to be realized in the future, in exchange for testimony in the MacNeill case, together with any documentation of the deal.”\n",
            "In response to the trial court's order, the State filed a Notice of Benefits Offered or Provided to Jailhouse Informants. The State disclosed consideration given to the State Inmate. It also represented—falsely, as it turned out—that the four federal inmates had not “requested any recommendations [from the State], nor has anyone else on [their] behalf. If any such request is made it will be honored. Other than that, there is no agreement to exchange [the federal inmates'] testimony for consideration from the State of Utah. Nothing has been given to [them], and there are no promises outstanding.”\n",
            "On the first day of trial, the court ordered that all witnesses be excluded from the courtroom while not testifying and also ordered that “fact witnesses shall not watch or listen to television, radio, or internet news coverage of the trial while under trial subpoena.” The prosecution did not inform the federal inmates of the exclusion order for almost a week.\n",
            "A. Medical Testimony\n",
            "At trial a cardiologist testified that the inflammation in Michele's heart was “benign” and not “severe enough to present a significant risk of cardiac death.” Dr. Grey also testified that the inflammation was “not very severe.” The State called an expert in forensic pathology, who testified that he found no evidence of myocarditis. The expert also presented a new theory on Michele's cause of death: drowning.\n",
            "The forensic pathologist based his conclusion on five facts. First, Michele regurgitated large amounts of water while emergency responders performed CPR, indicating that she had swallowed water. Second, she had water in her airway, which indicated that she had inhaled a significant amount of water. Third, her lungs were twice as heavy as typical lungs. Fourth, fluid was found in the chambers of her lungs. Finally, her blood was significantly diluted, which occurs when someone inhales water and it streams into the blood vessels and into general circulation.\n",
            "B. The Jailhouse Informants\n",
            "All five jailhouse informants testified against MacNeill.4 Inmate One testified that he knew MacNeill from a prison computer class. One night, Inmate One saw a picture of MacNeill on a television news show, and while he could not hear the audio, he could tell that the show claimed that MacNeill had murdered his wife. When Inmate One told MacNeill about the television show, MacNeill replied that “[t]hey're just [running the show] because my girlfriend is about to get out.” But MacNeill later “opened up about it.” He said that he “gave [his wife] some oxy and some sleeping pills and then he ․ got her in the bathtub.” MacNeill then said “he had to help her out,” and he “held her head under the water for a little while.” When Inmate One asked MacNeill why he killed Michele, MacNeill responded that “she was in the way” and “she wanted the house and the kids,” but that the authorities “couldn't prove that he ․ did anything.”\n",
            "Inmate One testified that he had not “made any request for any consideration.” MacNeill cross-examined Inmate One using phone records he had obtained from the prison. In one phone call Inmate One told his mother that the State was going to offer him a deal, and he would speak with his lawyer to find out the details of the deal. In numerous phone calls, he told family members that he planned on being released from prison by Christmas in exchange for his testimony because MacNeill's trial was scheduled for October 9 to November 9, and he would have “from November 9 up until Christmas to get out.” And in a phone call with his federal defense investigator, Inmate One explained that Jeff Robinson, the Utah County Attorney's Office investigator assigned to MacNeill's case, had told him that he was “willing to help [Inmate One] out in any way that he could.”\n",
            "MacNeill also confronted Inmate One with evidence of communications between Inmate One and Robinson in which Robinson stated, “What I really want is to get you out [early]. ․ You really are one of my key, absolute key witnesses. So it's really important to us to make sure that you are taken care of, and kept safe, and ․ to make sure that your needs are taken care of.” MacNeill also pointed out that Robinson had expressed a desire to communicate with Inmate One by phone rather than email so that MacNeill's defense attorneys would not learn of the communications between the two.\n",
            "Inmate Two testified that he was MacNeill's cellmate for two years. Inmate Two “heard rumors” that “supposedly [MacNeill] murdered his wife” and asked MacNeill whether it was true. Inmate Two testified that MacNeill told him that “they couldn't prove it,” and that the medication she was taking was prescribed.\n",
            "Inmate Three testified that he noticed an article about MacNeill in People magazine that claimed MacNeill murdered his wife. Inmate Three asked MacNeill if he had murdered his wife, to which MacNeill responded, “No, I didn't murder my wife. If I did, they don't have any evidence of it.”\n",
            "Inmate Four testified that he had heard that MacNeill killed his wife. When Inmate Four asked MacNeill about it, MacNeill responded, “The bitch drowned.”\n",
            "The State Inmate testified that he was housed in the same jail unit as MacNeill while MacNeill awaited the murder trial. The State Inmate asked MacNeill why he did not wear the same required jail-issued shoes as the other inmates, and MacNeill responded that he could “get away with a lot of things. For instance, ․ I'm getting away with my murder.” When asked if MacNeill elaborated on his statement, the State Inmate testified that MacNeill stated: “I'm getting away with murdering my wife.” The State Inmate testified that when he offered condolences for Michele's death, MacNeill said “Oh, no, I'm glad the bitch is dead.”\n",
            "The jury convicted MacNeill of murder, a first degree felony, and obstruction of justice, a second degree felony.\n",
            "MacNeill filed a post-trial Motion to Arrest Judgment or For a New Trial on the ground that the Utah County Attorney's Office failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in the form of consideration for Inmate One's testimony. MacNeill based the motion on emails and telephone call recordings from August through October. The various communications revealed that Inmate One planned on being released from prison in December 2013 in exchange for his testimony at MacNeill's trial. And sure enough, one week after trial, Robinson wrote letters to the U.S. Attorney's Office and Inmate One's federal defender highly recommending that “leniency be shown to [Inmate One] for his truthful and courageous testimony.” Inmate One was released from federal custody on December 13, 2013. The communications also revealed that, in violation of the court's exclusion order, Inmate One viewed portions of the trial testimony on the news before his scheduled date to testify.\n",
            "The trial court found that, although the State failed to disclose evidence of the deal between Inmate One and Robinson, “a jury possessed of this additional information would not have rendered a different verdict.” The court came to this conclusion because cross-examination demonstrated (1) that Inmate One “was ready to procure and accept early release by whatever means it could be obtained,” and (2) that Inmate One believed “testifying for the prosecution in Utah [would be] the catalyst for his early release.” The trial court found that although the State suppressed exculpatory evidence related to Inmate One, the new information provided by MacNeill in his post-trial motion was cumulative and “would not have been reasonably likely to affect the outcome of the trial.” The trial court therefore denied MacNeill's motion.\n",

            "Court Decision: The Matthews were found not guilty on charges of providing alcohol to minors at a wedding event. Their son, Thomas Matthews, pled guilty to underage purchase of alcohol and received a sentence including probation and community service.\n",

            "A Raleigh couple charged with supplying alcohol to minors at a June 2014 wedding has been found not guilty.\n",
            "Dr. Charles and Kimberly Matthews were acquitted Friday on four counts each of aiding and abetting the consumption of alcohol by minors.\n",
            "Jurors in Wake County Superior Court spent a total of about two hours deliberating on Thursday and Friday. On Friday morning, jurors spent about an hour examining 30 time-stamped photos from the wedding as well as copies of text messages. They were required to view the evidence in the courtroom at the request of defense attorney, Hart Miles.\n",
            "The couple’s son, Thomas Matthews, 19, who pleaded guilty to underage purchase of alcohol on Monday, was sentenced following the verdict in his parent’s case to 45 days in jail suspended, 18 months of unsupervised probation as well as 40 hours of community service. He must also surrender his driver’s license and will remain on probation until he is 21.\n",
            "Prior to sentencing, Thomas Matthews’ attorney asked the judge to consider his clients' age, academic achievement, volunteer work and lack of prior convictions in the decision.\n",
            "After leaving a wedding at the Matthewses home, Jonathan “JT” Taylor, 18, died in a drunken driving crash. The couple is still facing a civil lawsuit filed against them by Taylor’s family.\n",
            "“JT will always be a memory for me. He will always stay with me, physically on my body and in my heart,” said Thomas Matthews prior to sentencing.\n",
            "Speaking to the judge Friday afternoon, Thomas Matthews said that, due to his intoxicated state, he could not recall with confidence why Taylor decided to get behind the wheel that night. He also stated that he could not remember the last time he saw or spoke with Taylor.\n",
            "“Thomas and JT Taylor were best friends and he loved him like a brother. He always will,” said Smith.\n",
            "Superior Court Judge Osmond Smith said prior to sentencing that the case was not about compensating the Taylor family for the loss of their son but about responsibility. As he spoke, Taylor’s mother wiped away tears.\n",
            "“There’s nothing the court can do here to bring JT back to the Earth to his parents,” said Osmond Smith. “There’s nothing to repair or remove the heartache that they have. Nothing will remove the feeling they likely have every morning when they wake up that the loss of their son is still there, it’s real, it’s permanent.”\n",
            "The Taylor family issued the following statement through their attorney, Landon White, after the verdicts:\n",
            "\"Providing alcohol to underage persons is a serious issue and against the law. Such laws are in place to minimize the risk of tragedies such as the death of J.T. The Taylors are disappointed with the outcome, but respect due process and the jury’s decision. Despite the outcome, this case should create awareness that it is not okay to provide alcohol to underage persons, much less for adults and parents to provide alcohol to underage persons. If one life can be saved from awareness of this issue, the loss of J.T. will not be in vain. The Taylors would like to thank Jason Waller and others with the Wake County District Attorney’s Office who sought justice for J.T.\"\n",
            "Deliberation on the case against the Matthewses began late Thursday afternoon, after closing statements from both attorneys.\n",
            "In his closing arguments, Miles pointed out that it is legal to serve alcohol in a home and that there was no indication that the couple told bartenders at the event to serve alcohol to minors. In addition, Hart said it was the responsibility of the bartenders to check identification before serving alcohol.\n",
            "He also noted that, in many respects, 18-year-olds are considered young adults and questioned whether parents should be held responsible for their decisions.\n",
            "He said in looking through 4,000 photos from the event, police did not find a picture that showed the couple alongside teenagers with wine.\n",
            "\"I submit to you they are not criminals, and they should not be held criminally accountable for what happened,\" he said.\n",
            "The parents tried unsuccessfully to get their case dismissed, claiming they were unfairly discriminated against by the Wake County District Attorney's Office because neither the bartenders nor the person who sold their son the alcohol were charged.\n",
            "Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said Friday she believed there was enough evidence to take the case to trial, and she respects the jury's decision.\n",
            "\"We lose way too many young people as a result of underage drinking. Too many lives are cut short,\" she said. \"If we've managed to highlight an issue and prevent one person from losing their life, it will have been worth it.\"\n",
            "Miles said his clients \"take no joy\" in their acquittal and that will always think about Taylor.\n",
            "\"If they had any idea JT was going to drive, of course they would have intervened,\" he said. \"It's a tragedy.\"\n",
            "Miles also said the couple is thankful the emotionally charged case is over.\n",
            "\"The Matthewses have been publicly accused and ridiculed, and now a jury has told them they're not guilty. Hopefully, this will bring some measure of closure,\" he said.\n",

During the course of that trial, after being given a lawful oath, Defendant Andrea Sneiderman testified and was subject to cross-examination. Her testimony during State v. Neuman was the basis for subsequent perjury charges. For example, she told police she learned of her husband’s death at the hospital, although her father-in-law and a close friend both called her beforehand to inform her that Rusty had been killed.

            "Early life\n",
            "Mangum was born and grew up in Durham, North Carolina, the daughter of Travis Mangum, a truck driver, and his wife Mary. She was the youngest of three children. She attended Hillside High School, graduating in 1996.\n",
            "In 1996, Mangum filed a police report alleging that three years earlier, when she was 14, she had been kidnapped by three assailants, driven to Creedmoor, North Carolina, and raped. One of those she accused was her boyfriend, who was 21 at the time, which would constitute statutory rape. She subsequently backed away from the charges, a move relatives claimed was motivated by fear for her life. Mangum's father said he did not believe she was raped or injured, though her mother believed such an incident could have occurred—but not in 1993. She thinks it is more likely to have happened when Crystal was 17 or 18 years old, shortly before she made the police report. Mangum's ex-husband, Kenneth Nathanial McNeill, believed the incident occurred as she said it did.\n",
            "After graduation from high school in 1996, Mangum joined the US Navy. She trained to operate radios and navigation technology. While serving in the Navy, Mangum married McNeill. Her marriage quickly broke down. Mangum reported to police that her husband had threatened to kill her, but the charge was dismissed when she failed to appear in court. She served for less than two years in the Navy before being discharged after becoming pregnant by a fellow sailor, with whom she went on to have another child.\n",
            "By 2002, Mangum had returned to Durham and was working as an exotic dancer. In 2002, she was arrested on 10 charges after stealing the taxicab of a customer to whom she had given a lap dance. This prompted a police pursuit at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour, occasionally in the wrong lane. After being stopped, Mangum nearly ran over a police officer, succeeding only in hitting his patrol vehicle. She was found to have a blood alcohol content of over twice the legal limit. Ultimately, Mangum pleaded guilty to four counts: assault on a government official, larceny, speeding to elude arrest, and driving while impaired. She served three weekends in jail, paid $4,200 in restitution and fees, and was given two years' probation.\n",
            "In 2004, Mangum earned an associate degree from Durham Technical Community College, and subsequently enrolled full-time at North Carolina Central University. At the time of the rape allegations, she was in her second year, studying police psychology, and earning a 3.0 average.\n",
            "Duke lacrosse case\n",
            "In March 2006, Mangum was hired as a stripper at a party organized by members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team. After arriving in an intoxicated state, having earlier consumed alcohol and cyclobenzaprine, to perform with another stripper at a house rented by three of the team captains, she became involved in an argument with the occupants of the residence and subsequently left.\n",
            "Mangum then became involved in an altercation with her fellow stripper that necessitated police assistance. The officer who arrived on scene took her to a local drug and mental health center, where she was in the process of being involuntarily committed when, after being asked a leading question, she made a false allegation that she had been raped at the party. District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was up for re-election, pursued the case despite questions about the credibility of Mangum, and conspired with a DNA lab director to withhold exculpatory evidence that would have cleared the lacrosse players of the rape accusations. It took almost a year for the state's attorney general's office to dismiss the charges and declare that the players were innocent of the charges laid against them by Nifong.\n",
            "In 2008, Mangum published a memoir, The Last Dance for Grace: The Crystal Mangum Story, written with Vincent Clark. The book gives an unsubstantiated version of events, and she continued to insist on the debunked claim that she was assaulted at the party. Mangum claimed that the dropping of the case was politically motivated. The book also outlines her earlier life, reasserting her claim that she was raped at the age of 14.\n",
            "Attempted murder and murder charge\n",
            "Just before midnight on February 17, 2010, Durham police were called to Mangum's residence by her nine-year-old daughter. They said that, when they arrived, they found Mangum and her live-in partner, Milton Walker, fighting. She reportedly set fire to some of his clothing in a bathtub in their presence. The building suffered heavy smoke damage. They arrested Mangum on charges of attempted murder, first-degree arson, assault and battery, identity theft, communicating threats, damage to property, resisting an officer, and misdemeanor child abuse.\n",
            "Mangum was ordered to remain in jail on $1 million bond. Her bond was lowered to $100,000 in May, and she was released from jail to live in a friend's house. She was required to wear an electronic monitoring device. On July 12, 2010, Mangum was released from house arrest and required to move in with her mother. She was allowed to visit her three children but only under supervision of social services. Mangum was arrested again on August 25, 2010, and held on $150,000 bond for failure to comply with the restrictions on her child visitation order.\n",
            "On December 17, 2010, Mangum was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, injury to personal property and resisting a public officer. The jury deadlocked 9–3 in favor not guilty on the felony arson charge and was unable to reach a decision on it.\n",
            "After the verdict, Judge Abe Jones sentenced Mangum to 88 days in jail, which she had already served, and left the custody decision in the hands of social services. Durham Assistant District Attorney Mark McCullough announced on January 21, 2011, that he would not retry Mangum on arson charges.\n",
            "Case Facts\n",
            "Defendant and Reginald Daye (“Daye”) met through mutual friends in January 2011. One month later, the two began living together along with defendant's three children. On 3 April 2011, defendant and Daye went to a party around 11:00 p.m. and returned to the apartment complex where they lived (“the apartment”) approximately an hour and a half later. Durham Police Department (“DPD”) Officer Curtis Knight (“Knight”) was waiting for an illegally-parked vehicle to be towed from the apartment complex when defendant and Daye approached Knight's patrol car and asked what he was doing. Knight told them. Daye and defendant then entered the apartment, but a few minutes later they were back outside. Knight heard Daye yelling, “give me my money” at defendant, referring to $700 he had given defendant to hold for rent. After Knight told them that they could not be outside making so much noise, defendant and Daye went back inside the apartment.\n",
            "Daye's nephew, Carlos Wilson (“Wilson”), who lived in the same apartment complex, also heard the commotion and went outside where he encountered Knight. Wilson told Knight he would check on Daye; however, no one answered when Wilson knocked on defendant and Daye's apartment door. Wilson left and went to bed, but was awakened by a knock on his door at approximately 3:00 a.m. When he opened the door, Wilson found Daye standing there, shirtless, and bleeding from his left side. Daye told Wilson that defendant had stabbed him. Wilson then called 911 and attempted to provide medical aide until the paramedics arrived.\n",
            "At approximately 3:20 a.m., DPD Officer Bradley Frey (“Frey”) arrived at the apartment. Daye told Frey that he and defendant argued about money, the argument became hostile, and defendant stabbed Daye with a knife. As a result of a stab wound to the left side of his chest, approximately two to three inches deep, Daye sustained extensive injuries requiring emergency surgery. Daye died a few days later due to complications from the stab wound.\n",
            "Several DPD officers investigated and found broken glass, multiple knives—both broken and intact—and bloodstains throughout the apartment. A serrated knife, five inches long with Daye's blood on the blade, was laying flat on the living room couch. Daye's blood was also found on the kitchen counter, the hallway carpet, and the ground and staircase railing outside the apartment. The door from the hallway to the bathroom had been broken off its hinges, and a clump of hair was found on the bathroom floor. Another clump of hair was found in the master bedroom.\n",
            "DPD Officer C.N. Walker (“Officer Walker”) was also dispatched to the apartment and, upon his arrival, he learned where defendant was located. Shortly thereafter, DPD Officer Charles Franklin and Officer Walker arrested defendant at the nearby home of Liddie Howard (“Howard”), a friend who was watching defendant's children at the time. When Officer Walker arrived at Howard's home, he did not observe any obvious injuries on defendant; but after arriving at police headquarters, defendant claimed “to hurt all over.” Defendant had a scratch below her left eye, which was partially scabbed, and a lesion on the side of her lip.\n",
            "On 18 April 2011, defendant was indicted for the first degree murder of Daye. From December 2011 to November 2013, defendant filed numerous pre-trial motions which included, inter alia, a motion in limine requesting that the trial court prohibit “the State from mentioning or eliciting from any witness any alleged acts of [defendant's] prior misconduct ․ or any reference to defendant's past criminal conviction[s].” At the pre-trial motion hearing, the State informed the court that it intended to offer evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence regarding an altercation that occurred between defendant and a man named Milton Walker (“Walker”) in February 2010 (“the Walker incident”). Walker had known defendant since high school, and the two dated periodically before they began living together in a duplex (“the duplex”) in early 2010. Defendant's trial counsel expressed concern about the Rule 404(b) evidence, and stated that, “at a minimum,” the issue should be addressed at the appropriate time during trial. The trial court agreed, and asked that the prosecutor alert both the court and defendant prior to the introduction of any evidence sought to be admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b).\n",
            "Defendant's trial proceeded in Durham County Superior Court on 12 November 2013 for the first degree murder charge and two charges of larceny of a chose in action. During trial, the State addressed the Rule 404(b) issue regarding the Walker incident to the trial court prior to calling any 404(b) witnesses. The trial court held a voir dire hearing on the evidence, during which the State summarized the facts of the Walker incident and sought to introduce the evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) for the purposes of showing motive, opportunity, intent, absence of mistake or accident, plan, knowledge, and preparation. Defendant objected, but the trial court ultimately determined that a majority of the Rule 404(b) evidence was admissible and probative of motive, intent, and plan. As a result, multiple witnesses, including Walker, were permitted to testify regarding defendant's involvement in the Walker incident.\n",
            "The State also presented evidence from DPD Lieutenant Marianne Bond (“Bond”). Prior to his death, Daye spoke with Bond twice regarding the events that transpired between himself and defendant. Bond testified to Daye's statement of the events. After returning from the party, Daye and defendant argued in the apartment's parking lot until a DPD officer approached and told them to calm down. Inside the apartment, defendant called a male—whom Daye believed to be a police officer—to come pick her up and stated that she had a date. Defendant and Daye argued about defendant bringing other men to the apartment. Daye also demanded that defendant return his $700. After more arguing, defendant entered the bathroom and locked the door. Believing defendant had called an unidentified police officer to pick her up, Daye kicked in the bathroom door, grabbed defendant by the hair, and pulled her into the master bedroom. At some point, defendant retrieved multiple knives from the kitchen and “came at him three or four times.” As Daye attempted to protect himself, he received a cut on his hand. Daye was heading to the front door trying to leave the apartment when defendant stabbed him in the hallway.\n",
            "Daye also told Bond that he grabbed defendant during their argument, but he did not recall punching her that night, and insisted that he had never punched her. However, defendant hit Daye four to five times, including once in the eye. Daye denied ever holding or throwing any knives during the altercation. In response to Bond's question regarding multiple hair samples found in the apartment during the investigation, Daye admitted that he was probably the one that pulled out defendant's hair.\n",
            "Defendant testified in her own defense, and gave a much different account. According to defendant, Daye had never before complained about defendant bringing other men to the apartment. However, on the night in question, Daye felt disrespected because defendant was talking to other men. During their argument, Daye suddenly hit defendant, causing her to fall down on the living room floor. The fighting spilled over to the master bedroom. At some point, Daye went to the kitchen, retrieved several knives, and began throwing them at defendant as she hid behind a mattress. After defendant locked herself in the bathroom, Daye kicked in the door and dragged her by the hair back to the master bedroom, where Daye pinned defendant against the floor, hitting and choking her. In response, defendant grabbed a knife off the floor, “poked” Daye in his side, exited the apartment, and ran to Howard's home.\n",
            "On 22 November 2013, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of second degree murder and not guilty on the larceny charges. The trial court entered judgment and sentenced defendant to a minimum term of 170 months and a maximum term of 216 months to be served in the custody of the North Carolina Division of Adult Correction.

            "Laura Jean Ackerson (the victim) and Grant Ruffin Hayes (defendant) met in March 2007. Thereafter, the two engaged in a domestic relationship, but never married. Two children were born of the relationship, and once defendant and the victim separated, a custody dispute over the children ensued. In late 2009, defendant met Amanda Hayes (Amanda) and they began dating. Defendant and Amanda married in April 2010 and moved into an apartment in Raleigh. The victim lived in Kinston.\n",
            "On 29 June 2010, the Lenoir County District Court entered a consent order giving temporary physical custody of the children to defendant during the week and to the victim on weekends. As part of their temporary arrangement, the parties agreed to a psychological evaluation by Dr. Ginger Calloway, a forensic psychologist. After evaluating the parties over a period of time, Dr. Calloway issued a report recommending that defendant and the victim share legal and physical custody of the children. Over defendant's objection, Dr. Calloway testified about the contents of her report at trial.\n",
            "On 12 July 2011, defendant e-mailed the victim to suggest that she see the children for a mid-week visit. The victim drove to Raleigh on 13 July, texting defendant at 4:12 p.m., “I'm leaving the Wilson area now. I'll call when I get past the traffic. Where will you be in [an] hour or so?” The victim also called defendant, with the last outgoing call occurring at 4:59 p.m. near Crabtree Valley mall “going outbound toward [defendant's] apartment[.]” Chevon Mathes, the victim's friend and business partner, knew that the victim was going to Raleigh and expected a business related call from her at approximately 9:00 p.m., which she never received.\n",
            "In the early hours of 14 July, defendant bought goggles, trash bags, a reciprocating saw, blades, plastic sheeting, tarp, gloves, bleach, tape, and a lint roller at Wal–Mart and Target in Raleigh. Amanda called her daughter, Sha, later that morning, and Sha took the children to Monkey Joe's, a play center, in Raleigh for most of the day. On 16 July, defendant bought coolers and ice. He also rented a U–Haul trailer and indicated that his destination was Texas. Amanda called Sha and told her that she was going to Texas to see her sister, Karen Berry. Defendant, Amanda, and the children drove to Texas in the U–Haul and arrived at Ms. Berry's house in the late hours of 17 July or early in the morning of 18 July.\n",
            "On 19 July, defendant bought gloves and bottles of acid from Home Depot. Surveillance cameras captured Amanda dumping some of the bottles in an area near Ms. Berry's residence. Ms. Berry's residence was also located near a creek that was often used for fishing. Ms. Berry testified that defendant and Amanda took her boat into the creek on the night of 19 July. When investigators later searched the creek, they found the victim's decomposed and dismembered body parts. The State's expert witness pathologists testified at trial that the victim's cause of death was “homicide by und[et]ermined means” or “undetermined homicidal violence.”\n",
            "Defendant returned the U–Haul trailer on 20 July and drove with Amanda and the children back to Raleigh. Mathes became concerned about the victim's disappearance and notified law enforcement. After launching an investigation, law enforcement officers searched defendant's apartment on 20 July. In addition to a bleach stain, missing furniture, and cleaning products, they also found lyrics to a song entitled, “Man Killer.” The lyrics concerned the first-person killing of a woman by making her bleed and by strangulation. Over defendant's objection at trial, the trial court admitted the song lyrics into evidence.\n",
            "The State also offered the witness testimony of Pablo Trinidad at trial. Trinidad testified that in July 2011, he was being held in the Wake County Detention Center on federal charges while defendant was being held in the same location for the murder charge. Trinidad stated that he met defendant because they were housed in the same area. One day, inmates saw defendant's case being discussed on television and wanted to harm him, but Trinidad diffused the situation. Trinidad testified that at some point after this incident, defendant told him that he called the victim and “lured” her to his apartment under the “false pretenses” of settling the custody dispute, “subdued” her with Amanda's help, strangled her, and drove out of state to dispose of the body.\n",

Arias was convicted of first-degree murder on May 8, 2013, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on April 13, 2015. \n",
            "At the time of the murder, Alexander sustained 27 stab wounds, a slit throat and a single gunshot wound to the forehead. Arias testified that she killed him in self-defense, but nevertheless she was convicted by the jury of first-degree murder. During the sentencing phase, the jury deadlocked on the death penalty option, and Arias was thus sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Alexander's death and the subsequent investigation and trial received widespread media attention in the United States.\n",
            "Alexander was born on July 28, 1977, in Riverside, California, to Gary David Alexander and Pamela Elizabeth Morgan Alexander. At the age of 8, Travis moved in with his paternal grandparents. After his father's death in July 1997, his seven siblings were also taken in by their paternal grandmother. Alexander told a friend that, prior to joining a church, he would frequently engage in fights. He performed stand-up comedy under the alter ego \"Eddie Snell\" Alexander was a salesman and motivational speaker for Pre-Paid Legal Services (PPL)\n",
            "Arias was born on July 9, 1980, in Salinas, California, to William and Sandra (née Allen) Arias. She attended school until the 11th grade, at which point she dropped out of Yreka Union High School She was an aspiring photographer and worked odd jobs until she got a sales position with PPL.\n",
            "Arias and Alexander met in September 2006 at a work conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Arias converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which Alexander was a member, and was baptized by him on November 26, 2006 in a ceremony in Southern California. Alexander and Arias began dating in February 2007, and Arias moved to Mesa to live closer to Alexander, but then, in April 2008, she moved to Yreka, California, and lived there with her grandparents. Alexander and Arias dated intermittently for a year and a half, often in a long-distance relationship, taking turns traveling between their respective Arizona and California homes. Even when Alexander was in a different relationship, he and Arias would sext each other.\n",
            "Alexander's friends who knew Arias and observed them together reportedly had a negative opinion of her, stating that the relationship was unusually tumultuous and that Arias's behavior was worrying\n",
            "Alexander was murdered at his house in Mesa, Arizona, on Wednesday, June 4, 2008. He sustained 27 stab wounds, a slit throat, and a gunshot wound to the head. Medical examiner Kevin Horn would later testify that Alexander's jugular vein, common carotid artery, and trachea had been slashed and that he had defensive wounds on his hands. Horn further testified that Alexander may have been dead at the time the gunshot was inflicted and that the back wounds were shallow. Alexander's death was ruled a homicide. He was buried at Riverside's Olivewood Memorial Park cemetery.\n",
            "Alexander missed an important conference call on the evening of June 4. The following day, Arias met Ryan Burns in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan and attended business meetings for the conference. Burns later said that he noticed that Arias's formerly blonde hair was now dark brown and that she had cuts on her hands. On June 6, she left Salt Lake City and drove west toward California. She called Alexander several times and left several voicemail messages for him. She also accessed his cell-phone voicemail system. When Arias returned the car on June 7, it had been driven about 2,800 miles (4,500 km). The rental clerk testified that the car was missing its floor mats and had red stains on its front and rear seats. However, it could not be verified that the car had floor mats when Arias had picked it up, and the red stains could not be analyzed as the car was cleaned before police could examine it.\n",
            "On June 9, having been unable to reach Alexander, a concerned group of friends went to his home. His roommates had not seen him for several days, but they believed that he was out of town and thus did not suspect that anything was amiss. After finding a key to Alexander's bedroom, the group entered and found large pools of blood in the hallway to the master bathroom and Alexander's body in the shower. In the 9-1-1 call (not heard by the jury), the dispatcher asked whether Alexander had been suicidal or if anyone was angry enough to hurt him. Alexander's friends mentioned Arias by name as a possible suspect, stating that Alexander had told them that she had been stalking him, accessing his Facebook account and slashing his car's tires.\n",
            "While searching Alexander's home, police found his recently purchased digital camera damaged in the washing machine. Police were able to recover deleted images showing Arias and Alexander in sexually suggestive poses taken at approximately 1:40 p.m. on June 4. The final photograph of Alexander alive, showing him in the shower, was taken at 5:29 p.m. that day. Photos taken moments later show an individual believed to be Alexander \"profusely bleeding\" on the bathroom floor. A bloody palm print was discovered along the wall in the bathroom hallway; it contained DNA from both Arias and Alexander.\n",
            "On July 9, 2008, Arias was indicted by a grand jury in Maricopa County, Arizona for the first-degree murder of Alexander. She was arrested at her home six days later and was extradited to Arizona on September 5. Arias pleaded not guilty on September 11. During this time, she provided several different accounts about her involvement in Alexander's death. She first told police that she had not been in Mesa on the day of the murder and had last seen Alexander in March 2008. Arias later told police that two intruders had broken into Alexander's home, murdering him and attacking her. Two years after her arrest, Arias told police that she killed Alexander in self-defense, stating she had been a victim of domestic violence.\n",

            "The couple were not the intended targets of the shooting. They lived in a home previously occupied by a gang member named “Sancho.” Sancho had been the target of a previous shooting by a rival gang member named “Trigger,” who was accompanied by his brother, Moises, and two teenagers, Isrrael Vasquez and Defendant Jonathan Santillan.\n",
            "At the time of this earlier shooting, Sancho refused to provide much information to law enforcement about his attackers. But after reports of the Floreses' killings, Sancho contacted law enforcement and told them he believed he was the intended victim. He explained that he had lived at that residence a year earlier, before the Floreses moved in, and “Trigger” had visited him when he lived there. Law enforcement contacted Trigger's girlfriend, who identified Moises, Vasquez, and Santillan as Trigger's associates, and informed police that they carried a .45 caliber handgun and an AK-47 rifle.\n",
            "Police found Santillan and Vasquez in the attic of Vasquez's house and arrested them. After searching the attic, law enforcement also found an AK-47, a .45 caliber handgun, and several rounds of .45 caliber ammunition. The .45 caliber ammunition had scratch marks on the shell casings to obscure identifying information, and those scratch marks matched those found on casings at the Floreses' home and the earlier shooting involving Sancho.\n",
            "On 15 January 2013, officers interrogated Santillan in four separate interviews over an eight-hour period. At the time, Santillan was fifteen years old. Santillan initially denied his involvement in both the Sancho shooting and the Floreses' killings, but later confessed to being present at the Sancho shooting. Santillan denied any involvement in the Floreses' killings, but he gave a detailed description of the murders and made a sketch of the Floreses' home based on information he claimed to have learned from Moises. Law enforcement videotaped each of the four interviews.\n",
            "The State indicted Santillan on two counts of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, first degree burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, and possession of a firearm with altered serial number. At trial, the State sought to admit Santillan's videotaped interrogation and his sketch of the Floreses' home into evidence. Santillan moved to suppress this evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. The trial court denied the motion.\n",
            "Over Santillan's objection, the trial court also admitted rap lyrics found in a notebook in Santillan's room. The lyrics describe someone “kick[ing] in the door” and “spraying” bullets with an AK-47.\n",
            "The jury convicted Santillan on all charges. The trial court sentenced him to two consecutive sentences of life without parole and other, lesser sentences. Santillan timely appealed.\n",

            "\n",
            "In 2015, 35-year-old Mitchelle Blair was living on the east side of Detroit with her four children when she was evicted for not paying rent. At first glance, nothing about Blair’s case seemed particularly unusual. She was unemployed and had been struggling financially. Relatives say she had previously asked them for money.\n",
            "When the eviction crew from the 36th District Court showed up at Blair’s home on the morning of March 24, 2015, she wasn’t there. So the crew went inside and began removing furniture from the home.\n",
            "But when they went to move her freezer, they stumbled upon a horrifying discovery that would send shockwaves through the Detroit community.\n",
            "The Bodies In The Freezer\n",
            "When the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department bailiff opened a white deep freezer located in Mitchelle Blair’s living room, they discovered the frozen body of a teenage girl, wrapped in a large plastic bag. And buried beneath her was another body: a young boy, wrapped in a blanket.\n",
            "A neighbor didn’t waste any time disclosing Mitchelle Blair’s whereabouts. Police soon found her at another neighbor’s house with two of her children, aged eight and 17. But her other children, Stephen Gage Berry and Stoni Ann Blair, were missing.\n",
            "After some brief questioning, Mitchelle Blair confessed to killing the children and stuffing them in her freezer. As she was being handcuffed, she reportedly told the police that she wasn’t evil.\n",
            "“It was just an evil act,” she said, according to WCNC Charlotte.\n",
            "Meanwhile, authorities took the bodies to a morgue, where they had to thaw for three days before an autopsy could be performed. The bodies were identified as Stephen Berry and Stoni Blair.\n",
            "The medical examiner ruled their deaths homicides, naming blunt force trauma as their cause of death. The medical examiner also ruled that “thermal injuries” had contributed to Stephen’s death. It was determined that Stephen was killed in August 2012 at the age of nine, and Stoni was killed in May 2013 at the age of 13.\n",
            "They had been in the freezer for over two years.\n",
            "The Murder Of Stephen Gage Berry\n",
            "Mitchelle Blair confessed to the murders at the Wayne County Circuit Court. According to the Times Record, she told Judge Dana Hathaway that she killed the “demons” after finding out they were sexually abusing her youngest son — a claim that has never been substantiated.\n",
            "Blair said that one day in August 2012, she walked into a room of her Detroit home to find her youngest son simulating sexual activity using toys. Horrified, Blair asked him if anyone had ever touched him that way. The boy allegedly told her that his nine-year-old brother Stephen had.\n",
            "Blair stormed into Stephen’s room in a rage. After Stephen allegedly confessed to sexually abusing his younger brother, Blair immediately began punching and kicking him. She said she continued to torture her son over a period of about two weeks, starving him, making him drink Windex, asphyxiating him with a plastic bag, and repeatedly pouring scalding hot water on his genitals, causing his skin to peel off.\n",
            "At one point, she wrapped a belt around his neck, lifted him up, and asked, “Do you like how this feels?”\n",
            "“Blair lifted Stephen off the ground by holding onto the ends of the belt while the belt was still wrapped around Stephen’s neck,” said a petition to terminate Blair’s parental rights to her surviving children, as reported by USA Today. “Blair used ‘Force Flex’ bags to put over his nose and mouth, suffocating Stephen until he lost consciousness, and Blair then ‘slapped him awake.'”\n",
            "Stephen succumbed to his injuries on Aug. 30, 2012. After finding him unresponsive beside a puddle of vomit, Mitchelle Blair wrapped his body in a blanket and hid him in her deep freezer.\n",
            "The Murder Of Stoni Ann Blair\n",
            "Nine months after murdering Stephen, Mitchelle Blair claimed she found out that her 13-year-old daughter Stoni was also raping her youngest son. Blair reportedly asked the boy repeatedly if Stoni had abused him; he repeatedly said no — until Blair threatened to beat him if he didn’t tell the “truth.”\n",
            "Blair began starving Stoni and brutally torturing her until she died in May 2013. According to the petition, Blair had punched Stoni in the face “a lot,” beat her with a two-by-four, and asphyxiated her with a garbage bag until she lost consciousness.\n",
            "Later, Blair would claim that while killing Stephen was an “accident,” she had meant to kill Stoni.\n",
            "“I don’t feel no remorse for the death of them demons,” she later said, according to PEOPLE. “At first, I cried but I would kill them again. There were no other options.”\n",
            "Mitchelle Blair put Stoni’s body in a plastic bag and stuffed her in the freezer on top of Stephen. Then, she continued on as if nothing were amiss.\n",
            "Stephen Gage Berry and Stoni Ann Blair were in the deep freezer for almost three years. No one looked for them. The children’s fathers were largely absent from their lives, and Blair had previously taken all of the children out of school. When neighbors asked about the children’s whereabouts, Mitchelle Blair always had an excuse.\n",
            "Mitchelle Blair’s Conviction\n",
            "In court, Mitchelle Blair told the judge that she did not feel any remorse over her actions.\n",
            "“[They] had no remorse for what [they] did to my son,” she said. “There’s no excuse for rape.”\n",
            "Prosecutor Carin Goldfarb stated that they found no evidence of rape, and Mitchelle’s oldest child, Gabi, said there was “no concrete evidence” that either of the children sexually assaulted her younger brother.\n",
            "“My mom became obsessed with this crazy notion that my siblings had sexually assaulted our youngest brother, and she started basically interrogating the youngest,” Gabi Blair said in January 2023 when she spoke out about her horrifying childhood on the Investigation Discovery true crime show, Evil Lives Here.\n",
            "Gabi claimed that her youngest brother only told Mitchelle about the alleged sexual assault after incessant questioning because “he didn’t know any better.”\n",
            "“My mom was a ticking time bomb,” Gabi said. “She always had her fuse lit. So anything, the slightest tap, would set her off.”\n",
            "In June 2015, Mitchelle Blair pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree premeditated murder and one count of felony murder. She is now serving a life sentence at the Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan without the possibility of parole.\n",

            "Gabi Blair and her younger brother went to live with their great aunt after their mother’s conviction. They both went back to school, and the young boy was eventually adopted. They have since been in therapy to deal with the trauma and abuse they faced at the hands of their mother.\n",
            "“I was afraid to even walk by the freezer. Every time I came downstairs to eat breakfast or to play a video game, I had to walk right past the freezer,” Gabi recalled. “But there was nowhere else that my mom could hide the bodies. They were cooped up in a freezer like meat.”\n",
            "Mitchelle Blair continued to torture Gabi and her younger brother even after the deaths of Stephen and Stoni. Gabi said she was repeatedly burned with a curling iron and beaten with a wooden plank — and that she was constantly terrified she would become the next body in the freezer.\n",
            "“I made sure to watch what I said around [my mother],” Gabi said. “I already knew that one misstep and this is where I’d end up… I’m happy I was able to make it out alive.”\n",

            "\n",
            "The testimony presented at trial demonstrated that Brienna Campos, Remington Campos, Brandon Campos, and Alex Zaldivar resided at a home owned by the Camposes' parents in Ocoee, Florida. At around noon on May 9, 2012, Brienna, Brandon, and a friend, William Harrington, were watching television in the living room. Alex was asleep in his room and Remington was at work. Brienna, Brandon, and William saw a blue or purple Monte Carlo drive up and down the street and assumed that someone was lost. Subsequently, two men rang the doorbell and Brandon answered. They put guns in Brandon's face and ordered him back inside. The men followed Brandon in, ordered Brienna, Brandon, and William to lie face down and found Alex in his room and ordered him out to join the others. They used video game controllers and costume handcuffs to tie the victims up. The men asked whether the home was a grow house and inquired where the drugs and money were. When they found neither, the men took some bags, some smaller electronic items, a small amount of cash, and Brandon's house keys and left. William was able to release himself from the costume handcuffs and untie the Camposes. They were able to then call the police. William was able to use the find my phone feature on his cellular phone to help the police track the assailants. Brienna, Brandon, and William rode with police to another location and identified Okafor and Nolan Bernard as the two men who had just invaded their home as well as the Monte Carlo the men had driven.\n",
            "Bernard and Okafor were arrested and the stolen items were returned. Bernard was jailed awaiting trial, but Okafor was fitted with an ankle monitor and released on home confinement to the residence owned by his sister, Takeethia Ruffin. Okafor's trial for the May 9 home invasion was set for September 11, 2012. Brienna, Brandon, Alex, and William were scheduled to testify.\n",
            "On August 24, 2012, Okafor sent a text message to someone named “Dorey” asking “did you get that?” to which Dorey responded “it's here with a full clip.” Okafor also told Dorey that his lawyer had informed him that all the witnesses were planning to show up. On September 9, 2012, Okafor exchanged text messages with a friend, Antoine McLaren. Okafor texted that he was worried about his case and asked McLaren to procure a hoodie and gloves because he was worried about returning to jail. Okafor texted “I can't let them show up.” McLaren declined to procure the items.\n",
            "On September 10, 2012, at approximately 3:45 a.m., Okafor called Sherria Gordon and told her to get ready because he was coming to pick her and her children 1 up. Okafor picked Sherria up from her home in Takeethia's white Malibu and dropped the children off to continue sleeping at Takeethia's house. Okafor's ankle monitor corroborated this evidence, showing him away from his home from 3:49:27 to 4:08:28 a.m. Sherria and Okafor drove to Nesly Ciceron's house, where Okafor woke Nesly, handed him the keys to a white Taurus, and instructed him to follow Okafor. As they were driving, Nesly pulled up beside Okafor and indicated that the Taurus needed gas. Both cars stopped at a Marathon gas station where Sherria was filmed paying for the gas purchase at 4:45 a.m. After refueling, both cars continued to an abandoned house where they met Donnell Godfrey and Emmanuel Wallace who were driving Candace Ruffin's white Impala.2\n",
            "Okafor handed Emmanuel's phone to Nesly and asked him to remain at a described location and to call if he heard police approaching. Okafor likewise instructed Sherria to wait at a location and to call if she heard police approaching. Okafor, Donnell, and Emmanuel drove the Impala to the Camposes' neighborhood. They were filmed by three surveillance cameras located at a house on the corner near the crime scene. The footage showed a white Impala passing by one of the cameras at 5:07 a.m. The video recording contained audio of four gunshots, with the first occurring at 5:21 a.m. followed by three consecutive shots. The cameras then showed the Impala heading in the opposite direction at 5:24 a.m.\n",
            "At the Camposes' residence, Brienna and Remington were awakened by the sound of Brienna and Brandon's dogs barking. Brienna testified that she was pulled out of her room by a tall, lanky man who wore a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and a t-shirt covering his head so that she could only see his eyes and hairline. The unidentified man showed her his pistol and forced her out of her bedroom to the living room and had her lie face down. Alex was already lying face down and she was placed so close that their heads touched. Remington testified that he was removed from his bedroom by a heavy-set man with short dreads carrying a Glock pistol. On his way to the living room, Remington observed a tall, thin man with long dreads carrying an AK–47 assault rifle. Both Brienna and Remington testified to seeing only two assailants.\n",
            "One of the assailants did all the talking. He asked “where are the other two?” presumably referring to Brandon and William who were present at the May 9 home invasion. He also asked “who is the naked guy?” referring to Remington who had not been present for the May 9 home invasion. He asked about the drugs and money and Brienna said “you're going to be disappointed just like you were before.” Both Brienna and Remington testified that he said “someone is going to get shot tonight.” Brienna testified that she thought the statement was just made to scare them. Brienna and Remington both testified that they heard the sound of rubber gloves snapping into place before hearing the first shot. Brienna testified that after she heard the first shot, she thought it had been a mistake due to adrenaline. She felt the pressure on the left side of her head. She then heard two more gunshots. Remington heard the first shot and said he knew Brienna had been hit because he knew it wasn't right next to him or himself. Remington heard the second shot and heard Alex stop breathing. He then heard the third shot and said it felt like someone had dropped bricks on the back of his head and blood started blocking his vision. The assailants left and Brienna and Remington climbed over their back fence to their neighbors' home. Amy Scott answered the door and saw the two of them covered in blood. Brienna used the Scotts' phone to call police, who responded at 5:24 a.m.\n",
            "Video surveillance captured the white Impala leaving the neighborhood around the same time. Sherria testified that Okafor called her and told her to return to the abandoned house. When she arrived, the other two cars were there. Nesly testified that he left his location before he was instructed but nevertheless returned to the abandoned house to await the others' return. He testified that he was the first car to arrive back, followed by the Impala, followed by Sherria in the Malibu. Nesly testified that Godfrey was driving the Impala on the return trip and that Okafor got out of the Impala and into the car with Nesly who then drove Okafor home. Sherria testified that Godfrey got into the car with her and she drove him down the street until he indicated where to let him out. She then returned to Takeethia's house, where Okafor was already standing outside. She and Okafor then went to bed.\n",
            "Okafor's jury trial commenced on August 10, 2015. At the end of the trial, the jury convicted him of one count of first-degree premeditated murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of armed burglary of a dwelling with explosives or a dangerous weapon. The penalty phase commenced on August 27, 2015.\n",
            "At the penalty phase, the State presented testimony from Brienna Campos, Remington Campos, Denise Zaldivar, Richard Zaldivar, Kyoko Zaldivar, and Rafael Saldivar. Okafor presented testimony from Trenton James, Catalina Ruffin Sinclair, Trevor Sinclair, Marcia Pete, Dr. Edward Taylor, and Dr. Stephen Gold. The jury voted eleven to one to sentence Okafor to death. The Spencer 3 hearing occurred on October 13, 2015, where the State presented testimony from Kyoko, Rafael, and Brienna. Afterwards, the trial court found four aggravating circumstances,4 thirteen mitigating circumstances,5 and sentenced Okafor to death.\n",
            "First, Okafor argues that the trial court erred in striking Juror 105 for cause based on his allegedly equivocal responses to whether he would be able to impose the death penalty after determining it was the appropriate punishment. We conclude that there was no error.\n",
            "A trial court has great discretion when deciding whether to grant or deny a challenge for cause based on juror competency. Barnhill v. State, 834 So.2d 836, 844 (Fla. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 917, 123 S.Ct. 2281, 156 L.Ed.2d 134 (2003). This is because trial courts have a unique vantage point in their observation of jurors' voir dire responses. Therefore, this Court gives deference to a trial court's determination of a prospective juror's qualifications and will not overturn that determination absent manifest error. Hertz v. State, 803 So.2d 629, 638 (Fla. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 963, 122 S.Ct. 2673, 153 L.Ed.2d 846 (2002). Where a prospective juror is challenged for cause on the basis of his or her views on capital punishment, the standard that a trial court must apply in determining juror competency is whether those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of a juror's duties in accordance with the court's instructions and the juror's oath. Id. (citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)). “In a death penalty case, a juror is only unqualified based on his or her views on capital punishment, if he or she expresses an unyielding conviction and rigidity toward the death penalty.” Barnhill, 834 So.2d at 844.\n",
            "Conde v. State, 860 So.2d 930, 939 (Fla. 2003);  see Fernandez v. State, 730 So.2d 277, 281 (Fla. 1999). We have previously held that a juror's “[p]ersistent equivocation or vacillation ․ on whether he or she can set aside biases or misgivings concerning the death penalty in a capital penalty phase supplies the reasonable doubt as to the juror's impartiality which justifies dismissal.” Hurst v. State, 202 So.3d 40, 62 (Fla. 2016) (quoting Johnson v. State, 969 So.2d 938, 947–48 (Fla. 2007)).\n",
            "The record demonstrates that Juror 105 never clearly stated that he could follow the law. Even when directed to assume that he had determined that the death penalty was appropriate in this case, Juror 105 stated he was unsure that he could vote to recommend it. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing Juror 105 for cause.\n",
            "Next, Okafor argues that the trial court erred in permitting the State to introduce evidence of high capacity .22 and .223 caliber magazines recovered from Emmanuel Wallace's residence. The State argues that the magazines were relevant to establish that it was Wallace who carried the AK–47 described in Remington Campos' testimony. We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence, but that the error was harmless.\n",
            "In order to be admissible, evidence must be relevant. That is, the evidence must “tend [ ] to prove or disprove a material fact.” § 90.401, Fla. Stat. (2012). While relevant evidence is generally admissible, such evidence “is inadmissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” §§ 90.402–403, Fla. Stat. (2012). “A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence and such a determination will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.” Jorgenson v. State, 714 So.2d 423, 427 (Fla. 1998) (citing Heath v. State, 648 So.2d 660, 664 (Fla. 1994)).\n",
            "Davis v. State, 207 So.3d 177 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, –––– S.Ct. ––––, L.Ed.2d –––– (2017).\n",
            "The evidence here was not relevant. Despite the State's argument, the magazines did not tend to establish the identity of the assailant carrying the AK–47 because an AK–47 does not fire .22 caliber or .223 caliber rounds. Accordingly, the discovery of high capacity magazines of those calibers did not corroborate Remington's testimony that one of the assailants carried an AK–47, nor did it establish that Wallace was that assailant. See Huhn v. State, 511 So.2d 583, 589 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987) (finding a gun not relevant when there was nothing unlawful about owning the gun itself and nothing connecting that particular gun to the crime). However, such error was harmless because Wallace's ownership of .22 and .223 caliber high-capacity magazines was not prejudicial to Okafor. See Herman v. State, 396 So.2d 222, 229 (Fla. 4th DCA 1981) (“There being no reasonable basis upon which a different verdict could have been reached, if admission of the shotgun[, where the State's expert testified it was not likely the gun used in the crime,] was error, it was harmless.”).\n",
            "Next, even though not challenged by Okafor, we have an independent duty to review the evidence to determine whether there is competent, substantial evidence to sustain the conviction in this case. We conclude that the record contains competent, substantial evidence to support this conviction. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that on May 9, 2012, Bessman Okafor and Bernard entered the Camposes' home while armed and took money and electronics. After their arrest, trial was scheduled to begin on September 11, 2012.\n",
            "The day before trial, Brienna, Remington, and Alex were asleep in their home. Brienna awoke to the sound of her dog barking and was pulled out of bed by a tall, lanky man carrying a pistol. Remington awoke to the sound of both his siblings' dogs barking and was pulled out of bed by a short, heavy-set man with short dreads carrying a Glock. Remington also saw a tall, lanky man with long dreads carrying an AK–47.\n",
            "Brienna, Remington, and Alex were placed face down next to each other, so close that their heads were touching. Brienna testified that she heard the first shot fire, thought it was an accident, and then felt herself be shot. Remington testified that he heard Brienna and Alex being shot before he felt himself shot. The State presented testimony from a firearms expert who testified that the projectiles recovered were from a .38 caliber handgun that could not have been a Glock. She further testified that because no shell casings were recovered, the handgun was likely a revolver and not a semi-automatic.\n",
            "Testimony demonstrated that Okafor arranged for Sherria and Nesly to serve as lookouts. Okafor, Wallace, and Godfrey were filmed by the neighbor's surveillance camera arriving at the crime scene. Text messages, cellular data, and Okafor's ankle monitor all demonstrate that he coordinated the crime and was at the crime scene during the time the murder took place.\n",
            "While neither Brienna nor Remington testified that they saw a man who fit Okafor's description, and were only able to describe Wallace and Godfrey, they both testified that one of the assailants asked questions that would only make sense if he had been present at the May 9 incident. Specifically, they testified that the unidentified assailant asked “where are the other two” presumably referring to Brandon and William who were present at the May 9 incident but not at the September 10 incident. He also asked “who is the naked guy?” presumably referring to Remington, who was present at the September 10 incident, but not the May 9 incident. The unidentified assailant would likely have only been able to identify the victims this way if he had been physically present at both incidents and the only other person other than Okafor who was at the May 9 incident, Nolan Bernard, was in jail awaiting trial.\n",
            "The jury could reasonably conclude that Okafor planned, coordinated, and executed the murder and attempted murders in this case. Accordingly, we find competent, substantial evidence in the record to affirm Okafor's conviction for the first-degree murder of Alex Zaldivar.\n",
            "Lastly, Okafor argues that because the jury did not unanimously find the facts necessary to sentence him to death and did not unanimously recommend the death sentence, Florida's capital sentencing scheme and his death sentence are unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Hurst v. Florida, ––– U.S. ––––, 136 S.Ct. 616, 193 L.Ed.2d 504 (2016), and this Court's decision in Hurst v. State, 202 So.3d 40 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, –––– S.Ct. ––––, L.Ed.2d –––– (2017). We agree. See Franklin v. State, 209 So.3d 1241, 1248 (Fla. 2016) (citing Hurst, 202 So.3d at 41). We explained in Hurst “that the Supreme Court's decision in Hurst v. Florida requires that all the critical findings necessary before the trial court may consider imposing a sentence of death must be found unanimously by the jury.” Hurst, 202 So.3d at 44. We also held, “based on Florida's requirement for unanimity in jury verdicts, and under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, that in order for the trial court to impose a sentence of death, the jury's recommended sentence of death must be unanimous.” Id. Because the jury vote in this case was eleven to one, and the aggravating factors required factual determinations by the jury, the Hurst error in this case was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Franklin, 209 So.3d at 1248.\n",
            "In Hurst, this Court determined that Hurst v. Florida error is capable of harmless error review and set forth the following test:\n",
            "The harmless error test, as set forth in Chapman[v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967),] and progeny, places the burden on the state, as the beneficiary of the error, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict or, alternatively stated, that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the conviction.\n",
            "Hurst, 202 So.3d at 68 (quoting State v. DiGuilio, 491 So.2d 1129, 1138 (Fla. 1986)). We stated that a sentencing error is only harmless “if there is no reasonable probability that the error contributed to the sentence.” Id. (citing Zack v. State, 753 So.2d 9, 20 (Fla. 2000)). To find the error harmless in this case, we would be required to speculate why one juror was “persuaded that death was not the appropriate penalty.” Id. at 69. We therefore find that the Hurst error in this case is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and Okafor is entitled to a new penalty phase. See id.\n",
            "Because we find that Hurst requires that Okafor receive a new penalty phase, we decline to address the remaining issues on appeal. We affirm Okafor's conviction and remand for a new penalty phase proceeding.\n",
            "It is so ordered.\n",
            "I fully concur in the majority's decision to affirm Okafor's conviction. I have also elected to concur in the majority's decision to vacate Okafor's death sentence now that the United States Supreme Court has denied certiorari in Hurst v. State (Hurst), 202 So.3d 40 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, ––– S.Ct. ––––, ––– L.Ed.2d ––––, 2017 WL 635999 (2017). Although I continue to view this Court's decision in Hurst as misguided for the reasons expressed in Justice Canady's Hurst dissent, see Hurst, 202 So.3d at 77–83 (Canady, J., dissenting), the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari renders Hurst final, solidifying it as this Court's precedent.\n",
            "While I recognize that I am not necessarily bound by our precedent and could continue to dissent and express my disagreement, my duty is to faithfully apply Florida law to the issues raised by those litigants whose sole state court appeal right is in our Court. At this point, Hurst is the law in Florida—whether I agree with it or not—and issues governed by our Hurst precedent will continue to be decided by our Court in pending death penalty proceedings for at least several more months. Accordingly, I concur in the decision to grant Hurst relief because that is what a faithful application of now-settled Florida law requires in this case.\n",

            "Defendant(s): Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez\n",
            "Victim: James Boyd\n",
            "Court Decision: After a lengthy legal process, the trial of the officers charged with the shooting ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, with three voting guilty and nine not guilty. No convictions were obtained in the case.\n",
            "Case facts:\n",
            "\n",
            "James Matthew Boyd (April 8, 1975 – March 16, 2014) was an American man who was fatally shot by Albuquerque Police Department officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque, New Mexico on the evening of March 16, 2014. A resident of a nearby subdivision called police at 3:28 p.m. to report that a man had been camping on the mountain behind his house for the previous month, a violation of local regulations. Two Open Space officers were the first to respond. They approached Boyd as he lay under a sheet of plastic; Boyd, mentally ill with a diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, became irate, wanting to know why the \"raid\" was occurring. When an officer tried to pat him down, he produced two pocket knives, threatening the officers with them. The caller watched the confrontation from his second-story window and later testified that Boyd threatened the officers.\n",
            "The Open Space officers called for backup and Albuquerque police and New Mexico State police responded. A police officer with crisis intervention training testified that he had made some progress with Boyd, but that his supervisor pulled him off and sent him to secure the perimeter of the standoff location. Officer Mikal Monette testified that Boyd never did drop his knives and surrender, but did put them away and agreed to keep his hands out of his pockets. K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch stepped into the role of negotiator and supervisor, he said, because there was no dialogue taking place when he arrived.\n",
            "Boyd eventually said he would depart, picked up some of his possessions, and took a step downhill. An officer said \"Do it.\" (referring to the use of a stun grenade). Sandy threw a Stun grenade at Boyd, and Rick Ingram, the acting ROP sergeant at the site, fired his Taser shotgun, but it did not have any noticeable effect on Boyd. At the same time Weimerskirch sent the dog to bite him, then ran to the dog when it attacked the blue bag rather than Boyd. Startled, Boyd produced the knives again. Perez and Sandy testified that they felt he posed an imminent threat to Weimerskirch. Sandy said he moved closer to cover the dog and its handler. As officers approached, Boyd turned a quarter turn to his left and was shot.\n",
            "Boyd fell forward, face first, away from the officers, wheezing but still holding a knife in each hand. When he did not respond to commands to drop the knives, another officer fired three beanbag shotgun rounds which struck his buttock and the police dog was again sent to bite him. Boyd arrived at the University of New Mexico Hospital emergency room at 8:15 p.m., underwent extensive surgery, and was pronounced dead of massive trauma at 2:55 a.m. the next morning. Surgeons had amputated his right arm, removed his spleen, part of one lung and part of his colon in their efforts to save his life.\n",
            "A preliminary hearing was held in August 2015, and the trial of two police officers charged with second-degree murder in Boyd's death began on September 20, 2016.\n",
            "The trial concluded with Judge Alicia Hadfield declaring a mistrial on October 11, 2016. The jury deadlocked with three voting guilty and nine voting not guilty. The jury deliberated for two days after hearing 12 days of testimony in state district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In February 2017, Raúl Torrez, the Bernalillo County District Attorney, after having several prosecutors around the state review the case, announced that he would not refile charges against Officers Sandy or Perez. In July 2017 the United States Attorney's Office in New Mexico said, \"After a careful and thorough review into the facts surrounding the shooting, federal investigators determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, a violation of the federal statute,\" ending the inquiry into possible criminal civil rights violations. Sandy retired from the Department. Perez was fired but appealed his termination. He won his arbitration and subsequently returned to work at the Department in May 2017. He was assigned to a desk job for a year and was barred from responding to patrol calls or providing services. He was awarded back pay and benefits in the amount of $143,159.\n",
            "Background\n",
            "James Matthew \"Abba\" Boyd, 38, was experiencing homelessness at the time. Authorities said he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had been a prisoner in the Bernalillo County Jail in Albuquerque and the Doña Ana County Jail in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He had also been transported to a psychiatric hospital. The last lawyer to represent Boyd, John McCall, says he had no doubt that Boyd was mentally ill. He said, the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute, the state mental health hospital in Las Vegas, New Mexico, determined that Boyd was not dangerous, and also that no treatment existed that would render him competent to stand trial. Therefore, they released him. McCall said Boyd was creative but clearly delusional.\n",
            "A cousin remembered him fondly from visits to an aunt's farm that allowed them both to escape their families for a while. Boyd's cousin described him as funny, sensitive and intelligent. Boyd's alcoholic mother and physically abusive father lost custody of him when he was five; consequently he was in foster homes by the time he was five, and there he was sexually abused. He entered the juvenile justice system at fifteen, where he remained for two years. He was arrested again soon after turning eighteen. Those charges were eventually dropped, but by then he had spit jalapeño at a jailer's eyes and tried to escape. By the time his family got Boyd a lawyer for the new charges, he had already entered a guilty plea and was waiting to be sentenced.\n",
            "Boyd understood by then that he was mentally ill and asked at his mental health evaluation to receive probation, counseling and job training. But he was found competent to stand trial; he was convicted and sentenced to ten and a half years in jail. All his appeals were denied, and he spent seven years in prison. Todd Holmes, the Alamogordo lawyer who tried to prevent his incarceration in that case, defended Boyd again in 2001. Boyd had been arrested trying to enter Holloman Air Force Base, claiming he was on a mission from former President Gerald Ford that involved national security. Boyd's mental deterioration while in prison was evident to Holmes. He says that, after Boyd's release, the man began to identify as \"Abba Mobus Abadon,\" a name derived from \"God\" and the Hebrew word for \"a bottomless pit\".\n",
            "In January 2002, Boyd was arrested while breaking into the Las Cruces offices of the FBI. In 2005 he was arrested for assault after he told a man in downtown Albuquerque's Civic Plaza \"I am God and I want to hurt you.\" Charges were dropped four months later. Boyd was arrested again in 2007, for refusing to leave a fire station. He had told firefighters that he was a government agent and wanted to send them to hell. At the jail, he punched a corrections officer. In 2009, he got into a fight at St. Martin's, an Albuquerque soup kitchen, and cut another man with a box cutter. In 2010, staffers at the downtown library called police because Boyd was telling people that he was God, frightening them. He \"was charged with breaking an Albuquerque police officer's nose during [the] scuffle.\" While incarcerated, Boyd was charged with breaking a window at the jail. He later said guards had refused to feed him. McCall represented him on the new charge of breaking the window, and Boyd was referred again to the state mental health hospital.\n",
            "The confrontation with police that resulted in Boyd's death began with a call to police from Northeast Heights resident Alexander Thickstun. Thickstun had first noticed Boyd on February 27, 2014, when he heard Boyd yelling \"irrational things\" in the darkness at 1 am, and threatening to kill another man in the area. Thickstun called police once in February, and again on March 16, after he had discovered Boyd's illegal campsite - about 100 yards from his home - while on a hike. During Sandy and Perez's murder trial, Thickstun testified that he called police because he was concerned for his own safety and that of his wife. He described Boyd's behavior as \"scary\" and said that his wife was \"terrified.\"\n",
            "Standoff\n",
            "Officers responded to the base of U Mound, the foothill area where Boyd was camped in violation of park rules; these require a permit for camping in City of Albuquerque Open Space areas. Boyd's campsite was 300 yards from the Sandia Mountain Wilderness in the Cibola National Forest. He was within the Albuquerque city limits, in the Foothills Open Space area, and approximately a hundred yards from Thickstun's home.\n",
            "Two Open Space officers, the first to respond, arrived with guns drawn but not pointed at Boyd. When they tried to search him, Boyd produced a knife with a partially-serrated blade about 3 1/2\" (8.9 cm) long. As the confrontation wore on, Boyd produced another knife and threatened the officers with both of them. A witness, Alexander Thickstun, testified that Boyd threatened to kill the officers if they approached him. One officer, John McDaniel, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd did not attack him but threatened him, saying he was going to kill McDaniel and his partner, and refused to show the officers his hands. When the officers tried to pat him down, Boyd displayed two knives and threatened them with the knives, so they did not complete the search, he said. Additional officers responded. Crisis Intervention officer Brock Knipprath, who was at the scene, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd would not negotiate and talked nonsense. He testified that this behavior is considered a cue that a person might be mentally ill.\n",
            "Sandy's intent before shooting\n",
            "At his trial, Sandy testified for four hours about his actions in the standoff and a comment he made before the shooting to another officer about how he was going to shoot Boyd, whom Sandy referred to as a \"lunatic.\" Two hours before the shooting, officer Keith Sandy encountered New Mexico State Police Sergeant Chris Ware on Piedra Vista, the street closest to Boyd's campsite. Sandy knew Ware from his prior employment with the State Police, and greeted him. Ware's dash cam and belt recorder continued to record as they spoke. Sandy told Ware that Boyd was \"a fucking lunatic\" and threatened to shoot him during a conversation about Taser shotguns. Sandy had responded to the standoff because a police sergeant had requested a Taser shotgun, and he was carrying one.\n",
            "Some initially thought his remark was evidence of intent to shoot Boyd, but Ware said that Sandy was referring to using a Taser shotgun when they were talking.\n",
            "Shooting\n",
            "At least 19 police officers eventually responded to the scene, from the SWAT, crisis intervention and field services APD teams, as well as the New Mexico State Police, at Boyd's request. The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Boyd's brother against the City of Albuquerque lists 41 individual officers as defendants in addition to the city itself. Special prosecutor Randi Mcginn presented a slide during her opening statement in the trial that showed 19 officers present, \"encircling\" Boyd. The standoff between Boyd and police forces lasted about four hours, with Boyd making a variety of claims including that he was on a mission for US Special Forces, and could kill all of the officers present with one phone call.\n",
            "Perez was one of the last to arrive at the scene; he was dispatched at 7:01 p.m. and had been in the South Valley suburb of Los Lunas. Dispatch messages about the call while he was on his way to the scene described Boyd as making threats, with a history of running away from officers and injuring them. He threatened to kill police officers who came near him. At one point crisis intervention officer Mikal Monette was able to talk Boyd into surrendering, but as he was gathering his belongings he was told he could not bring his knives. Boyd stated, \"I have every right to bring my knives,\" and called that deal off.\n",
            "The sun had set by 7:15, and Boyd was still not giving into police demands. At 7:24 p.m., police officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch, and a police dog approached Boyd's location. Boyd saw them coming, and gathered some of his belongings as if preparing to voluntarily depart. There appeared to be a chance he'd cooperate, according to video released by APD. He said \"All right, don't change up the agreement. I'm going to try to walk with you.\" Boyd picked up his knapsack and slung it over his shoulder, then picked up a blue nylon bag full of other belongings.\n",
            "Boyd's hands were empty. He put on his backpack, reached down to pick up a thermos, put it in his right hand and grabbed a blue bag in his left hand. Just as he took his first step to walk down, Sandy threw a flash-bang grenade.\n",
            "Sandy said when interviewed that he had wanted to arrest Boyd before complete nightfall, to avoid the problems that darkness would bring. He threw a flash-bang grenade toward Boyd, but it bounced and, according to Sandy, landed in a rocky area to Boyd's right. Officer Rick Ingram fired a Taser shotgun at Boyd, but this did not appear to have any effect. Ingram said later that he had already called for a beanbag shotgun because he knew the Taser would not work. Trial testimony later showed that Boyd was wearing multiple layers of clothing when he was shot, and that one of the Taser probes was returned to police by the medical examiner with Boyd's clothing. Weimerskirch released the police dog to bite Boyd but it was distracted, possibly by the flight and explosion of the flash-bang. In a deposition for the civil rights lawsuit brought by Boyd's family, Weimerskirch said he believed the dog might have been shocked by a Taser probe. As the dog ran up to him, Boyd dropped the bags he had picked up and retrieved his knives from his pockets. With one knife in each hand, he assumed a squared off stance. Officers then ordered Boyd to drop the two knives several times, but he did not comply.\n",
            "The police dog moved in but did not bite Boyd; The dog grabbed one of the bags and brought it to his handler who had moved towards Boyd in order to get the dog to drop the blue bag. His back-up officers followed. Boyd took a step towards the officers and stopped. The canine handler tried to redirect the dog to Boyd. This put him 8'-10' from Boyd, looking down at his dog. Officers Sandy and Perez both testified at their trial that they thought that Boyd presented an imminent deadly threat to Weimerskirch, the dog handler. Sandy and Perez fired a total of three shots each. Three of those bullets hit Boyd from behind, one in the back and one in each arm. He had been turning around to his left before they started firing and he fell to the ground, face down, still holding both of his knives, wheezing. After he fell to the ground Boyd said \"Please don't hurt me. I can't move.\"\n",
            "Police approached cautiously thinking the knives might still present a danger. The officer with a beanbag shotgun summoned by Ingram just arrived with the bean bag shotgun just after the rifle fire, and fired three bean bag rounds at Boyd. The handler released the police dog again and it attacked Boyd's lower right leg, biting and shaking his calf. Police then disarmed and handcuffed Boyd as he lay wheezing on the ground. A forensic pathologist later testified that one of the bullets had passed through Boyd's spleen, transverse colon, and lower and upper lobes of a lung. Boyd died early the next morning at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Forensic pathologist Sam Andrews, a prosecution expert witness, testified at the preliminary hearing that Boyd died from gunshot wounds and sheer loss of blood.\n",
            "A May 29, 2014 autopsy report, by the medical examiner at the University of New Mexico said a toxicology screen had been negative. Boyd did not have either drugs or alcohol in his system when he died.\n",

            "Defendant’s convictions arise from the death of her son, 32-year-old Ramsay Scrivo, and the dismemberment of his body, the remains of which were discovered in 12 pieces near Fred Moore Highway and Allington Road in St. Clair County. The prosecution presented evidence that defendant drugged her son with Xanax,1 strangled him, dismembered his body, and scattered the remains along the highway. \n",
            "Defendant was living with the victim at the time of his death. The victim’s neighbors testified that they last saw him on January 24, 2014. On January 30, 2014, defendant was observed in a silver SUV along Fred Moore Highway and Allington Road driving slowly and disposing of something from the SUV. Earlier that day, and also on the previous day, defendant was seen by the victim’s neighbors loading large garbage bags into her vehicle. Later that day authorities found the victim’s remains scattered in bags along Fred Moore Highway and Allington Road. Along with the victim’s remains, authorities also found a power saw that was the same model number that witnesses recalled defendant purchasing from a Lowe’s store earlier that week.2 A subsequent search of the victim’s home did not reveal any large blood stains, but investigators did testify to a strong smell of bleach and the existence of small blood stains. One of the victim’s neighbors also testified that between January 25 and January 30 she heard a saw being used and that during the same time, she smelled both a burning and chemical odor emanating from the victim’s apartment. \n",
            "The medical examiner who performed the victim’s autopsy, Dr. Daniel Spitz, testified that the cause of death was asphyxiation and that, due to large amounts of Xanax in his system, he believed that the victim had been drugged before being killed. Defendant had a prescription for Xanax and a search revealed 10.5 pills missing from her most recent prescription. An analysis of defendant’s and the victim’s cell phone records also did not reveal any calls made from the defendant to the victim after January 24 despite several witnesses testifying that defendant asked them if they had seen the victim and defendant’s filing of a missing person’s report for the victim. \n",
            "Defendant testified in her own defense. According to her testimony, on the morning of January 26, 2014 she observed a masked man in the victim’s room who said he was going to kill the victim. Defendant testified that this man tied her to the bed and then brought her back into the victim’s bedroom when he had finished killing the victim. Defendant testified that the man remained five days but that she never saw his face due to the mask he was wearing. Defendant stated that the man then made her help dispose of the victim’s body threatening to harm further members of her family if she did not comply. \n",
            "The jury did not accept the defendant’s defense and convicted her of first-degree premeditated murder, mutilation of a human body, and removing a body without medical examiner permission. Donna Kay Scrivo was convicted of drugging and suffocating her adult son and dismembering his body. Her first-degree premeditated murder conviction earned her a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n",

            "Victim(s): Candace Conti\n",
            "Court Decision: In June 2012, the jury awarded Candace Conti $28 million in compensatory and punitive damages, finding that the defendants were negligent and did not adequately protect her from a known predator within the congregation. However, the punitive damages were later reduced, and the final judgment was significantly lowered upon appeal.\n",
            "Case facts:\n",
            "\n",
            "The Jehovah's Witnesses is a religion with about 1.2 million members in 13,400 congregations in the United States.   In the 1990's, Watchtower was in charge of the church's policies.   Congregations are comprised of elders, ministerial servants, and rank-and-file members called “baptized publishers.”   All members in good standing are considered “ministers.”   Elders are the spiritual leaders of their congregations, comparable to clergy in other religions.   Ministerial servants do administrative work such as distributing literature to members, and handling microphones at meetings.   Watchtower admitted that Fremont Congregation elders Gary Abrahamson and Michael Clarke were Watchtower's agents while acting within the course and scope of their church duties.   In addition to Sunday and midweek meetings, Congregation activities include field service, where small groups, usually consisting of two or three people, go door-to-door in neighborhoods to spread the church's spiritual teachings.\n",
            "Congregations are small and close knit.   The average congregation has 75 to 150 members.   At different times, the Fremont Congregation had from 100 to 140 members, of whom 6 to 13 were elders.   Evelyn Kendrick (Evelyn), who was married to Kendrick during the period when he molested Conti, testified that “we only socialized with people of that congregation.   We were kind of—well, not told outright, but that we should only associate with people of that religion and not of any other religion because they could be a bad influence.”   Congregation members call each other “brother” and “sister.”\n",
            "Conti and Kendrick were Fremont Congregation members in the 1990's, and for a time Kendrick was a ministerial servant.   Conti testified that Kendrick began molesting her around the time she turned nine years old in late 1994, and continued until 1996 or 1997, when she was age 10 or 11.   Before Kendrick molested Conti, the Congregation elders learned that he had molested his stepdaughter.\n",
            "In November 1993, elder Clarke received a call from Evelyn or Kendrick asking for a consultation about Kendrick's abuse of Evelyn's daughter.   Clarke and Abrahamson went to their home that week and spoke with Kendrick, Evelyn, and her daughter.   The elders were told that, four months earlier, Kendrick had touched his stepdaughter's breast around the time of her 14th birthday.   The stepdaughter told Evelyn about the molestation minutes after it occurred, but Evelyn testified that she did not immediately report it because she thought it was an isolated incident and she was “trying to deal with it” within the family.   The details of what the elders were told about the incident were disputed at trial.   Among other things, Evelyn disputed the elders' testimony that she told them to keep the incident private, and that Kendrick said he touched her daughter “inadvertently.”   Even so, the elders did not believe the touching was accidental.\n",
            "The elders told Evelyn and her daughter that they were free to report the incident to the police.   Abrahamson testified that they neither encouraged nor discouraged Evelyn and her daughter from doing so;  “[i]t was up to them.”   Evelyn reported the incident to the police in February 1994.   Kendrick admitted touching his stepdaughter's breast, and was convicted of a misdemeanor.   Elders at the Congregation did not learn of Evelyn's report to the police until a couple of years later.\n",
            "After meeting with the Kendrick family, Clarke wrote a letter to Watchtower to report “a case of child abuse” by Kendrick.   Abrahamson testified that the Congregation was required to contact Watchtower for instructions in such a situation.  The copy of the letter in evidence is heavily redacted.   In the unredacted portion, the letter stated that the Congregation had phoned Watchtower about the Kendrick matter, the “legal department had given us some direction,” and Watchtower had asked the Congregation to submit its questions in writing.   The letter said the elders planned to tell the Congregation that Kendrick would no longer be acting as a ministerial servant, and asked Watchtower to advise if that was an “incorrect” course of action.   Clarke testified that Watchtower responded to his letter, but he did not provide the substance of the response and no written response is in evidence.   The testimony was simply:  “Q. And Watchtower did respond to the letter and he was removed as a ministerial servant? A. Correct.   And we announced that.”\n",
            "Allen Shuster, a Watchtower official in New York, testified that Watchtower policy allowed a known child molester to continue to perform field service, but not alone or with a child.   Defense expert Monica Applewhite, whose testimony is discussed further below, said that Watchtower policies were implemented by letters sent “to all bodies of elders in the United States.”   However, Shuster was unable to identify any church-wide writing that documented the limitations on field service by known child molesters.   He said this policy was implemented by letters to elders on a case-by-case basis.\n",
            "Abrahamson testified that he told the Fremont Congregation elders what he learned at the Kendrick family meeting, and they agreed that Kendrick was no longer fit to serve as a ministerial servant.   They removed Kendrick from the position, and announced his removal to the Congregation without disclosing the reason for it.\n",
            "Clarke testified that the Fremont Congregation elders were following Watchtower policy in keeping information about the molestation confidential.   That policy was set forth in a July 1, 1989 letter from Watchtower to all elders in the United States, and it was a centerpiece of Conti's case against Watchtower.\n",
            "The letter addressed the elders' “duties that may involve legal issues or questions.”   Watchtower instructed the elders they “must be careful not to divulge information about personal matters to unauthorized persons․  Elders must give special heed to the counsel:  ‘Do not reveal the confidential talk of another.’  (Proverbs 25:9) ․ Improper use of the tongue by an elder can result in serious legal problems for the individual, the congregation, and even the Society. Worldly persons are quick to resort to lawsuits if they feel their ‘rights' have been violated.   Some who oppose the Kingdom preaching work readily take advantage of any legal provisions to interfere with it or impede its progress.   Thus, elders must especially guard the use of the tongue.”\n",
            "The letter continued:  “The spirit of the world has sensitized people regarding their legal ‘rights' and the legal means by which they can exact punishment if such ‘rights' are violated.   Hence, a growing number of vindictive or disgruntled ones, as well as opposers, have initiated lawsuits to inflict financial penalties on the individual, the congregation, or the Society.   Many of these lawsuits are the result of the misuse of the tongue․ The legal consequences of a breach of confidentiality by the elders can be substantial.   If the elders fail to follow the Society's direction carefully in handling confidential matters, such mistakes could result in successful litigation by those offended.   Substantial monetary damages could be assessed against the elders or congregation.”\n",
            "The letter went on to discuss “what to do in specific cases,” such as “[s]earch warrants and [s]ubpoenas,” “[c]rimes and [c]riminal investigations,” “[w]hen [l]awsuits are [t]hreatened,” and “[c]hild [c]ustody.”   On the subject of “[c]hild [a]buse,” the letter stated:  “Many states have child abuse reporting laws.   When elders receive reports of physical or sexual abuse of a child, they should contact the Society's Legal Department immediately.   Victims of such abuse need to be protected from further danger.”   The letter concluded with “points to remember,” such as “[b]e extremely careful with written material,” and “[a]ppreciate the [i]mportance of [m]aintaining [c]onfidentiality.”   With respect to confidentiality, the letter stated:  “Elders must exercise extraordinary caution when it comes to handling confidential information about the private lives of others.   Do not mistakenly minimize the gravity of a breach of confidentiality.   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can result in costly lawsuits.   Even if a lawsuit turns out favorably, valuable time and energy that could have been devoted to Kingdom interests will be lost.”\n",
            "Clarke testified that the policy stated in the letter was intended to protect confidential ministerial communications as well as to avoid legal liability.   He thought that “confidentiality is important for a minister.”   He asked, “Why would anybody come to us with their problems if they knew that as soon as they come to us we were going to announce it?   Why would anybody confess to a Catholic priest if they knew that after they confessed it was going to be announced at mass next week.   It is ludicrous. So [the policy was] put in place so that the friends would feel comfortable coming to us and we could keep confidence.”\n",
            "Clarke testified that the elders told Kendrick he could not “show affection to children, put children on his lap, work with them out in the door-to-door ministry, work with children in the Kingdom Hall. And we made it clear to him that we were going to be watching him.   And we did, all, the whole body of elders.”   Elder Lawrence Lamerdin said the Congregation had 10 to 13 elders at the time and they “made sure that [Kendrick] was watched.”   Abrahamson saw “no need” to inform the Congregation that Kendrick had molested a child because the elders would have warned the parents of any child they saw Kendrick getting close to or isolating.\n",
            "In an August 1, 1995 policy letter to United States elders on the subject of child abuse, Watchtower stated:  “[S]teps should be taken to protect the child, or other children, from further sexual abuse.   Obviously, parents would be keenly interested in taking adequate precautions in this regard․  Loving elders, too, will want to act in a way that demonstrates their protective care, since the word ‘overseer’ carries the thought of one who watches over, a guardian, a shepherd of the flock․ It would be appropriate to talk very frankly to a former child abuser, strongly cautioning him as to the dangers of hugging or holding children on his lap and that he should never be in the presence of a child without another adult being present.”\n",
            "There was testimony that Jehovah's Witnesses conduct no activities such as classes or trips that by their nature separate children from their parents, and Clarke testified that parents in the congregations are regarded as “the first line of defense” in preventing child sexual abuse.   Parents were educated about child sexual abuse in Awake!, a publication distributed to all congregation members.   Child abuse was discussed at length in the January 22, 1985 issue, which covered topics such as “Who Would Do a Thing Like That?” and “You Can Protect Your Child.”   The subject was also the focus of the October 8, 1993 issue, which addressed the question “How Can We Protect [Our Children]?”   The discussion under that heading stated:  “Tragically, adult society often unwittingly collaborates with child abusers.   How so?   By refusing to be aware of this danger, by fostering a hush-hush attitude about it, by believing oft-repeated myths.   Ignorance, misinformation, and silence give safe haven to abusers, not their victims.”   Both issues addressed misconceptions about child sexual abuse, including the belief that such abuse is most commonly perpetrated by strangers to the victims, and the 1985 issue gave as an example a girl who was molested by “a man who was running a church group.”\n",
            "Conti testified that she met Kendrick at the Fremont Congregation's Kingdom Hall, a building for Congregation meetings that seats 220 people.   She said that Kendrick insinuated himself into her family, befriended her father Neal at meetings, and then began coming to their house.   He molested her several times a month for a couple of years.   With one exception, the incidents occurred at Kendrick's home, where he drove Conti after meetings and during field service.   On one occasion, Kendrick put his hand up her shirt while they were riding on a train with her father.\n",
            "Kendrick began getting physical with her by repeatedly hugging her at Kingdom Hall. She always went to Kingdom Hall with at least one parent, but Kendrick made her sit on his lap during meetings.   She sometimes went to field service without her parents, and Kendrick sometimes drove her to the group meetings that preceded the door-to door field service, where partners for the activity were assigned.   They did field service together many times without either of Conti's parents present.   Conti said that the molestations occurred while they were supposed to be performing field service:  “Our groups would go out, we would get our territories, and we would go out and service.   And we would do door to door. And then there were times when our groups would separate even further.   And we would go to ․ laundry mats ․ and things like that.   And sometimes he would take me ․ to go do some of these things and then we would end up at his house.”   Kendrick drove her to his house, and when he finished molesting her, they would go “[m]aybe to the Kingdom Hall. Maybe to lunch with the rest of the service group.”\n",
            "Conti's father Neal testified that he did not see Kendrick engage in any of the inappropriate behavior described by Conti.   Neal said he was always with Conti at meetings and during field service, he did not allow Conti to leave meetings with Kendrick, and did not see Kendrick hug Conti or Conti sit on Kendrick's lap.   Conti's mother Kathleen testified that she had mental health problems during the two years before she and Neal separated in July 1996, which prevented her from caring for Conti.   As a result, Conti was often on her own during that time.   Kendrick was always offering to help Conti and take her places, and Kathleen thought he was just being nice.\n",
            "Clinical social worker Laura Fraser counseled Conti and her parents from August 1996 to April 1998.   Fraser testified that Neal and Kathleen were going through a tumultuous divorce, and Conti had assumed a caretaker role in the family.   Neal and Kathleen were not “psychologically well-developed,” and it was “like three children, in some respects, living together.”   Conti's home life was chaotic and unpredictable.   There were a “multitude of emotional crises ․ particularly related to her mother,” and Neal's work and Congregation activities left him little time for Conti.   She was craving for adult care at the time, and extremely vulnerable to manipulation.   Fraser was not surprised that Conti did not disclose her sexual abuse during the counseling.   Fraser had told Conti that she would be required to report such abuse, and Conti had “no safety” because she “was still rescuing both parents.”\n",
            "Congregation member Carolyn Martinez testified that she saw Kendrick and Conti together at Kingdom Hall, and that he “was very enamored with her.   He just looked at her inappropriately․  I remember them holding hands.   I remember his arm around her.”   Martinez said that she never saw Conti come to Kingdom Hall or field service without a parent, but more than once she saw Kendrick and Conti together in field service.   Martinez recalled Conti sitting on Kendrick's lap in meetings at her home.\n",
            "Elders Clarke, Abrahamson, Lamerdin, and three Congregation members testified that at Kingdom Hall they did not see Conti get hugs from Kendrick, sit on his lap, or leave with him as Conti testified.   The Congregation members said they never saw Conti do field service with Kendrick.\n",
            "An expert testified for Conti about Child Sex Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, which describes behaviors often exhibited by victims, including delayed reporting of their abuse.   Physician notes in evidence state that Conti reported in August 2002 that she was sexually abused from around age nine to 13.   Conti did not recall that doctor visit, but remembered disclosing the molestations to her parents in 2003.   She disclosed the molestations to elders, including Clarke and Lamerdin, in 2009.\n",
            "A psychologist who was counseling Conti at the time of trial testified that she suffered from depression, anxiety, and most severely from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  A psychiatrist treating Conti testified that she was afflicted by PTSD due to the sexual abuse and she would require a lifetime of therapy.   A psychiatrist qualified as an expert in child and adolescent psychology testified that Conti reported having been molested hundreds of times, that she had severe, chronic PTSD, and she would require therapy costing $160,000.\n",
            "Anna Salter, a clinical psychologist and an expert on child sexual abuse testified for Conti that defendants, after learning that Kendrick had molested a child, did not meet the standard of care for organizations that sponsor or promote activities that bring adults and children together.   Salter said that, by 1993, the major religions and secular organizations conducting such activities had “adopted policies of transparency regarding known sex abusers.”   United Methodist Church policies, for example, were to “[u]phold the rights of children, speak out when abuses occur, and advocate for the strengthening and strict enforcement of these rights.”   Salter said that “people knew what the risk was when you had a child molester,” and that the standard of care “was not to keep it secret and let the person continue in the same activities with the same access to children.”   The standard of care required “reporting these cases ․ and making people aware ․ if they had a sex offender in their midst.”\n",
            "Monica Applewhite, a clinical social worker and an expert on child sexual abuse, testified for defendants that Watchtower's policy against “disclosing private information ․ very closely mirror[ed]” the codes of ethics of the National Association of Social Workers and the American Counseling Association.   Based on her review of the evidence, Applewhite opined that the Congregation never put Kendrick “into a position that required or allowed him to be alone with children, to be in supervision of children, [or] to spend time with children away from their families.”   Because the church's activities did not separate children from their parents, Appelwhite opined that its best means of protecting children was to educate parents about child sexual abuse, and it exceeded the standard of care for such education in the 1990's.   According to Applewhite, the elders met the standard of care in Kendrick's case when they left it up to Evelyn and her daughter whether to tell the police about the abuse he admitted, and “they kept a special watch on him and paid attention to whether or not he had any inappropriate contact with children within the meetings at Kingdom Hall.”\n",
            "Conti sued Watchtower, the Fremont Congregation, and Kendrick for damages for sexual abuse, alleging willful acts by Kendrick and negligence on the part of defendants.   The negligence consisted of failing to warn members of the Congregation that Kendrick was a child molester, and failing to restrict and supervise his participation in church activities.   Conti executed a covenant not to execute on any judgment against Kendrick, in exchange for his agreement not to participate in the case, or harass Conti or her witnesses.   Conti obtained leave to add a cause of action for “acts of malice” supporting punitive damages against Watchtower, arguing that Watchtower acted despicably and with conscious disregard for the safety of others by maintaining a “secrecy policy” with respect to child sexual abusers despite knowing of their “high recidivism.”   The “secrecy policy” was set forth in the July 1989 letter we have quoted at length.   Awareness of child abuse recidivism was exhibited in church publications such as the January 1, 1997 issue of The Watchtower, which stated that child sex abusers “may well molest other children.   True, not every child molester repeats the sin, but many do.”\n",
            "The jury found Kendrick, Watchtower, and the Congregation liable, and apportioned fault 60 percent to Kendrick, 27 percent to Watchtower, and 13 percent to the Congregation.   The jury awarded Conti $7,000,000 in compensatory damages, including $130,000 for future counseling and therapy, and $6,870,000 in non-economic damages.   The jury awarded $21,000,001 in punitive damages against Watchtower.   The court conditionally granted Watchtower's motion for a new trial on punitive damages, subject to Conti's acceptance of an $8,610,000 punitive damage award.   Conti accepted the reduced punitive damages, and judgment was entered against Watchtower for $10,464,900, against the Congregation for $893,100, and against Watchtower and the Congregation jointly and severally for $130,000.   Watchtower and the Congregation timely appeal.\n"
